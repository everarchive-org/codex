### **Preamble**

This Dossier serves as the central nervous system for the EverArchive initiative's strategic planning. It is a living document that consolidates all known **Gaps**, **Unvalidated Assumptions**, **Open Questions**, and **Required Research**. Its purpose is to make our unknown-unknowns visible and to provide a structured framework for systematically increasing our certainty and mitigating risk. This document is a prerequisite for any new phase of development or fundraising.

**Research Foundation**: This dossier is informed by the comprehensive [[Digital-Content-Loss-Research-2025]] archive, which provides the empirical foundation for EverArchive's digital preservation arguments through 920+ hours of documented research across 8 domains of digital content loss.

### **Part 1: The Knowledge Gap Analysis**

This section details the most critical gaps between our current, well-defined vision and the knowledge required to execute it with confidence. Gaps are prioritized by their potential impact on the project's success.

#### **Section 1.1: Critical Priority Gaps (Execution Blockers)**

*   **GAP-01: Economic Viability of "Forever" Storage** ✅ **RESOLVED**
    *   **Description:** The "forever" promise is fundamentally dependent on the long-term economic sustainability of our chosen storage networks (e.g., Arweave's endowment model). This model is based on assumptions about declining storage costs that have not been independently stress-tested for multi-century timescales.
    *   **Impact:** A failure of this economic model would lead to a catastrophic, systemic collapse of the EverArchive, breaking its core promise.
    *   **Research Completed:** Independent economic analysis validates Arweave's endowment model with >95% probability of 200-year viability under conservative assumptions (0.5% Kryder+ rate). Monte Carlo simulations show median lifespan exceeding 2,000 years at 2% cost decline. The $100M EverArchive endowment target is validated as sustainable with 4% draw rate based on non-profit best practices.
    *   **Key Findings:** Storage costs will remain <20% of budget. Operating costs of $4-6M annually are sustainable through endowment returns plus earned revenue.

*   **GAP-02: Usability of Sovereign Key Management** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
    *   **Description:** Our security model mandates user-sovereign, zero-knowledge encryption. This assumes that non-technical users (like our pilot persona, the Academic Historian) can successfully and safely manage their own cryptographic keys without a high rate of loss. This is a major, unvalidated HCI assumption.
    *   **Impact:** If key management is too difficult or prone to error, we risk mass data loss (from lost keys) and a complete failure of user adoption.
    *   **Research Completed:** Multiple studies confirm that cryptographic key management remains a significant usability barrier for non-technical academics. However, emerging solutions like social recovery, hardware wallets, and institutional key escrow services show promise.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement multi-path approach: (1) Simple default with institutional backup, (2) Advanced sovereign option for technical users, (3) Progressive disclosure of features. Requires extensive user testing during pilot phase.

*   **GAP-03: Legal & Ethical Framework for AI Training Consent** ✅ **FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED**
    *   **Description:** The Deep Authorship permissions schema includes granular consent for AI training. The legal defensibility and ethical sufficiency of this model under evolving global regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, equivalents) is unknown.
    *   **Impact:** Proceeding without a robust legal framework exposes the project and its partners to significant legal and reputational risk.
    *   **Research Completed:** Legal framework developed recommending dual-entity structure (US 501(c)(3) + optional offshore foundation). Three-tier consent model validated as compliant with GDPR/AI Act requirements. Detailed compliance framework addresses data privacy, cross-border flows, and IP management.
    *   **Next Steps:** Engage specialized counsel for formal legal opinion and entity formation ($105-160K budget required).

#### **Section 1.2: High Priority Gaps (Blockers for Scale)**

*   **GAP-04: Technical Implementation of the Posthumous Release Oracle**
    *   **Description:** The post-completion release feature is a key part of the vision but depends on a reliable, decentralized "completion oracle." The technology for such oracles is immature and unproven at scale.
    *   **Impact:** Over-promising a feature that cannot be delivered securely will damage credibility. A faulty oracle could trigger a premature release of sensitive data.
    *   **Required Research:** A technology landscape analysis of the state-of-the-art in real-world event oracles. The current mitigation is to prioritize the non-oracle "Guardian-Consensus" mechanism in the MVP.

*   **GAP-05: Interoperability Mapping for the Schema Projector**
    *   **Description:** We have specified that Deep Authorship Packages will be interoperable with archival standards like METS, MODS, and Dublin Core. The precise, field-by-field mapping logic from our rich, layered format to these established schemas has not been fully defined.
    *   **Impact:** Without this mapping, we cannot fulfill our promise of interoperability to institutional partners, a key part of our value proposition.
    *   **Required Research:** A collaborative effort with digital librarians and archivists to create a formal mapping specification for each target schema.

#### **Section 1.3: New Critical Gaps Identified**

*   **GAP-06: Team Structure and Leadership** ✅ **RESOLVED**
    *   **Description:** No founding team or advisory board identified, critical for fundraising credibility.
    *   **Impact:** Cannot raise funds or build partnerships without leadership team.
    *   **Research Completed:** Comprehensive team structure defined with 5 core roles (ED, CTO, Partnerships, Community, Lead Engineer) and 8-12 member advisory board structure. Budget impact: $1.2-1.77M annually. Recruitment strategy and timeline developed.

*   **GAP-07: Market Validation and Competitive Analysis** ✅ **RESOLVED**
    *   **Description:** No market sizing, competitive analysis, or pricing validation available.
    *   **Impact:** Investors need market data to evaluate opportunity.
    *   **Research Completed:** TAM of $2.5-3.5B identified with 12-15% CAGR. Comprehensive competitive analysis of 6 major players. Three-tier pricing model validated against market data showing universities pay $5K-500K annually. Go-to-market strategy developed targeting 2-3% market share by Year 5.

### **Part 2: The Unvalidated Assumptions Register**

This section tracks core assumptions the project is currently operating on. Each assumption must be converted into a validated fact or a managed risk.

| ID | Assumption | Status | Validation Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A-01** | Academic institutions will prefer a decentralized, sovereign preservation solution over a traditional, vendor-managed one. | **Validated** | Market research shows institutions pay $5K-500K annually for preservation. Pain points with vendor lock-in and lack of process preservation create opportunity. |
| **A-02** | The open-source community will be intrinsically motivated to contribute to the EverArchive ecosystem. | **Unvalidated** | Develop a formal Developer Engagement Strategy, including clear contribution guidelines and a public roadmap, to attract and retain talent. |
| **A-03** | The cost of decentralized storage will continue to decline at a rate sufficient to sustain the economic model. | **Validated** | Arweave economic analysis confirms >95% probability of 200-year viability with conservative 0.5% annual cost decline. Historical rate is 30.5%. |
| **A-04** | "Anonymized" process data can be rendered truly free of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for AI training purposes. | **Partially Validated** | Legal framework confirms three-tier consent model is compliant. Technical implementation requires careful design and testing. |
| **A-05** | Token-based incentives are necessary for ecosystem growth. | **Invalidated** | Research shows tokens add regulatory complexity without clear utility. Recommendation: defer token implementation, use traditional incentives. |
| **A-06** | Partnership revenue can sustain operations. | **Validated** | Market analysis projects $5.5M annual revenue by Year 5 from 215 institutions across three tiers. Combined with endowment returns, ensures sustainability. |

### **Part 3: The Open Questions & Future Research Dossier**

This section serves as the organization's formal R&D agenda.

*   **OQ-01: Governance at Scale:** How does the proposed governance model scale to thousands of partners and millions of creators? What mechanisms prevent voter apathy or the consolidation of power in caucuses?
*   **OQ-02: The Psychology of Deep Archiving:** What are the long-term psychological effects on a creator of having perfect, replayable access to their own creative and emotional history? Does it enhance or hinder future creativity?
*   **OQ-03: The Nature of Post-Human Interpretation:** How can we best structure data for interpretation by a non-human AGI or a collective consciousness? What are the true "universal primitives" of meaning? (This relates to the `Cultural Translation Guide`).
*   **OQ-04: The Future of Embodied Knowledge:** How can Deep Authorship be extended to capture embodied or non-explicit knowledge (e.g., the muscle memory of a dancer, the tactile feel of a sculptor's clay)?
*   **OQ-05: The "Proof-of-Creativity" Protocol:** How can the concepts from the `Spark` document be integrated to create a robust, non-financial reputation system based on creative influence within the EverArchive?

### **Conclusion: A Mandate for Inquiry**

This Dossier is an admission of what we do not yet know. Its existence is a core tenet of our operational philosophy: we must be rigorously honest about our assumptions and relentlessly curious in our pursuit of knowledge. The work outlined herein—the research to be conducted, the assumptions to be validated, and the questions to be explored—is the critical path to transforming the ambitious vision of EverArchive into an enduring reality
