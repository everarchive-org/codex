---

### **Article I: The Phased Implementation Roadmap**

The development and launch of EverArchive will proceed in four distinct, sequential phases. Each phase has a clear focus, a primary milestone, and a set of key deliverables.

#### **Phase 0: Pre-Launch Foundation (Duration: 3 Months)**

*   **Focus:** Preparing the ground. Securing the legal, financial, and partnership foundations before a single line of code for the main product is written.
*   **Primary Milestone:** Initial grant funding secured; First three institutions committed to infrastructure support through MOUs.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    1.  **Legal & Governance:** Non-profit entity established. Governance Constitution ratified by the founding board. Open-source license for DAP spec selected and approved.
    2.  **Financial:** First major grant proposal submitted. Endowment fund legally structured.
    3.  **Infrastructure Adoption:** Initial conversations with 10 institutions; MOUs signed with 3 early adopters (e.g., a university library, an artist estate, a digital art museum) for infrastructure testing.
    4.  **Technical:** Finalize DAP v2.0 specification and publish for community review.

#### **Phase 1: MVP & Pilot Program (Duration: 6 Months)**

*   **Focus:** Building the core tool and validating it with a high-need user group. The goal is to solve a real, immediate problem for a specific persona.
*   **Primary Milestone:** Successful infrastructure pilot with >100 creators from academic research community, validating the preservation tools and workflows.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    1.  **Product (MVP):** The **EverArchive Capture Tool** for desktop. It will be a local-first application focused exclusively on the "zero-to-DAP" workflow, including sovereign key management, layered data entry (Core, Process, Surface), and user-initiated upload to their own storage.
    2.  **Community:** Onboarding of the pilot user cohort. Establishment of a private feedback forum and support channel.
    3.  **Infrastructure:** A basic, public-facing **EverArchive Index** that can display the `Surface` metadata of DAP objects archived during the pilot.

#### **Phase 2: Ecosystem Growth & Discovery (Duration: 12 Months)**

*   **Focus:** Expanding from a single tool to a functioning ecosystem. Making the archived content discoverable and useful.
*   **Primary Milestone:** The public launch of the EverArchive Index with over 10,000 discoverable DAP objects and a functioning research API.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    1.  **Technology:** Launch of the **Schema Projector** (v1), the **Canonical API** (v1), and a public DAP viewer.
    2.  **Infrastructure Network:** Onboarding of 10+ institutions as infrastructure users, moving from pilot to full implementation.
    3.  **Community:** Launch of the first public Steward Training Program. Election of the first Working Groups.
    4.  **Product:** Release of v2 of the Capture Tool, incorporating pilot feedback and expanding to a second creator persona (e.g., Investigative Journalist).

#### **Phase 3: Scale & Standardization (Duration: 24 Months)**

*   **Focus:** Achieving network effects and establishing the DAP format as a trusted standard.
*   **Primary Milestone:** The EverArchive ecosystem achieves operational sustainability through its hybrid economic model, no longer solely dependent on initial grant funding.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    1.  **Standardization:** Active engagement with standards bodies (W3C, IETF) and formal partnerships with major creative software companies to integrate DAP export functionality.
    2.  **Governance:** The first full election of the EverArchive Assembly.
    3.  **Economic:** The Endowment Fund reaches 25% of its target capitalization. Institutional Partnership revenue covers a significant portion of operational costs.
    4.  **Global Reach:** The platform is internationalized, and regional stewardship communities are established.

### **Article II: Infrastructure Adoption Strategy for Phase 1**

#### **Section 1: Target Persona (MVP)**

*   **Persona:** **"The Academic Historian"**
*   **Rationale:** This persona was selected for the pilot due to a confluence of factors:
    *   **High Pain Point:** They face a severe risk of losing decades of unstructured research notes, annotations, and draft manuscripts.
    *   **Innate Need for Provenance:** Their professional discipline requires meticulous tracking of sources and the evolution of arguments, which aligns perfectly with the DAP Process Layer.
    *   **Technical Disposition:** They are generally comfortable with specialized software (e.g., Zotero, Scrivener, Obsidian) but are not necessarily crypto-native, making them an excellent test case for the usability of sovereign key management.
    *   **Institutional Connection:** They are embedded in universities and librariesâ€”our key institutional partners.

#### **Section 2: Value Proposition & Messaging**

*   **Core Message:** "Secure your life's work. Preserve the journey behind your research. The EverArchive Capture Tool is a private, sovereign digital shoebox for the notes, drafts, and 'aha' moments that become your legacy."
*   **Key Benefits (for this persona):**
    *   **Never Lose a Note Again:** A single, searchable, permanent home for all your research materials.
    *   **Trace Your Argument's DNA:** Automatically capture the evolution of your thesis from first note to final publication.
    *   **Own Your Legacy:** Your research archive is encrypted with your key, on your device, and stored in your own permanent storage account. We never see your data.

#### **Section 3: Channels & Outreach**

*   **Primary Channel:** Direct partnership with university libraries and history departments identified in Phase 0.
*   **Secondary Channels:**
    *   Presentations at major academic conferences (e.g., American Historical Association).
    *   Targeted articles in scholarly publications (e.g., *The Chronicle of Higher Education*).
    *   Engagement in niche online forums and communities for historians and researchers.

### **Article III: Product Requirements Document (PRD) - MVP Capture Tool**

*   **Product Name:** EverArchive Capture Tool v1.0 ("The Scholar's Vault")
*   **Target User:** The Academic Historian
*   **Core User Problem:** "I have decades of research notes, interview transcripts, and manuscript drafts scattered across Word documents, physical notebooks, and Zotero. I have no unified way to preserve them, and I live in fear of losing the context and connections between them."

#### **Section 1: Feature Set & Prioritization**

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Description | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P1-F01 | **Sovereign Identity & Key Setup** | A guided, high-security wizard for creating a DID and generating/backing up a master encryption key (mnemonic phrase). Must be clear that loss is irrecoverable. | **P0 (Must Have)** |
| P1-F02 | **DAP Project Creation** | User can create a new, local, encrypted DAP project container for a specific research topic. | **P0 (Must Have)** |
| P1-F03 | **Core Layer Capture** | A simple, always-on-top text/markdown scratchpad for capturing "fleeting notes" and unstructured thoughts. All entries are automatically timestamped and saved to the encrypted `core/` layer. | **P0 (Must Have)** |
| P1-F04 | **Process/Surface Layer Capture** | User can import and manage versioned documents (e.g., `.md`, `.docx`) into the `process/` and `surface/` layers. | **P0 (Must Have)** |
| P1-F05 | **Manual Annotation** | User can select any file or text block and add a contextual annotation (e.g., "This is the quote that sparked the whole thesis"). | **P1 (Should Have)** |
| P1-F06 | **User-Initiated Archival** | A simple interface to connect the user's Arweave wallet and upload the completed DAP to the network. The tool handles the transaction and records the TX ID. | **P1 (Should Have)** |
| P1-F07 | **Consent Dashboard** | A settings panel where the user can configure the three tiers of data use consent for their DAP. Defaults to "Archival Only." | **P2 (Could Have)** |
| P1-F08 | **Social Recovery Setup** | An optional flow for setting up Shamir's Secret Sharing with designated Guardians. This is explicitly for key recovery, not data access. | **P2 (Could Have)** |

#### **Section 2: Out of Scope for MVP**

*   Advanced search within the tool (local search will be basic).
*   DAP viewing and consumption features.
*   Direct collaboration features.
*   The Schema Projector (export functionality).
*   Integration with any oracles or automated systems.

The MVP is laser-focused on one thing: **getting a single user's rich, layered creative process securely into a DAP object and onto permanent storage.**
