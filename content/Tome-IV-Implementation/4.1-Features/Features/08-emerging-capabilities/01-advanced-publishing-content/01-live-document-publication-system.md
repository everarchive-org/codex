# Live Document/Publication System

**Feature ID**: 66  
**Category**: 8.1 Advanced Publishing & Content Features  
**Status**: Proven/Core capability  
**Source**: User Journeys (Illustrator, Chef, Author, Publisher)  

## Overview

Share "living" versions of works-in-progress that update automatically while preserving complete version history. Single permanent link always reflects latest version with full process documentation.

## Technical Description

### Core Capability
- **Dynamic Content**: Single permanent URI serves latest version automatically
- **Version Preservation**: Complete history maintained with Deep Authorship layering
- **Selective Sharing**: Granular control over which updates are public vs private
- **Process Documentation**: Full creative journey preserved alongside final work

### Implementation Details
- **Blockchain Anchoring**: Permanent URI with content-addressed updates
- **Schema Projection**: Same source renders as website, PDF, mobile app, etc.
- **Access Control**: Creator-defined sharing levels (public/professional/personal/intimate)
- **Notification System**: Subscribers notified of updates based on preferences

## Use Cases

### Content Creators
- **Evolving Portfolios**: Artwork collections that grow organically
- **Recipe Development**: Cooking techniques refined through community feedback
- **Writing Process**: Novels that develop publicly with reader engagement
- **Educational Content**: Course materials that improve based on student needs

### Collaborative Work
- **Multi-Author Projects**: Shared documents with individual contribution tracking
- **Community Resources**: Open-source documentation with distributed maintenance
- **Research Publications**: Papers that incorporate ongoing peer review
- **Cultural Projects**: Community-driven preservation efforts

## Stakeholder Benefits

- **Content Creators**: Maintain audience engagement throughout creative process
- **Collaborative Teams**: Seamless coordination with contribution attribution
- **Readers/Audience**: Access to evolving content with notification preferences
- **Educators**: Dynamic learning materials that improve over time
- **Researchers**: Living documentation of research processes

## Technical Specifications

### Requirements
- **Permanent URI**: Blockchain-based addressing ensuring link persistence
- **Version Control**: Git-like branching with cryptographic integrity
- **Access Management**: Role-based permissions with temporal controls
- **Format Flexibility**: Multi-format rendering through Schema Projector
