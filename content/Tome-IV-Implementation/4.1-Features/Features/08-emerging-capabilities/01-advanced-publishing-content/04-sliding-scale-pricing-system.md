## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture
```solidity
contract SlidingScalePricing {
    struct PricingTier {
        uint256 basePrice;
        uint256 minimumPrice;
        uint256 solidarityPrice;
        mapping(address => uint256) userTier;
        mapping(address => uint256) verificationScore;
    }
    
    function calculatePrice(address user, bytes32 contentId) 
        external view returns (uint256) {
        // Economic verification logic
        uint256 economicScore = getEconomicScore(user);
        uint256 geographicFactor = getGeographicFactor(user);
        uint256 accessibilityNeed = getAccessibilityNeed(user);
        
        return computeFinalPrice(economicScore, geographicFactor, accessibilityNeed);
    }
    
    function verifyFairness(address user, uint256 chosenPrice) 
        external returns (bool) {
        // Prevent abuse while maintaining privacy
        return economicVerification(user, chosenPrice);
