# Feature: 15:1 ROI on Investment

**Feature ID**: 39  
**Category**: Economic Infrastructure / Network Sustainability  
**Status**: Validated  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

The 15:1 ROI on Investment feature demonstrates how $50M in initial funding generates over $150M in preserved value, cost savings, and economic benefits within the first decade. This exceptional return on investment reflects the compound value of permanent infrastructure - once built, it serves millions of users for centuries with minimal additional cost.

Traditional technology investments depreciate rapidly, requiring constant reinvestment. Infrastructure investments, particularly in digital preservation, create perpetual value streams. The 15:1 ROI comes from eliminated recurring costs, prevented data loss, enabled research, time savings, and new economic opportunities. This return makes EverArchive one of the highest-impact investments in digital infrastructure.

For funders evaluating impact per dollar, this ROI demonstrates that supporting EverArchive creates more value than almost any alternative investment in the knowledge preservation space.

## Technical Details

### How It Works

Value creation compounds through multiple channels:

1. **Direct Cost Savings**
   - Storage costs: $500M saved over 10 years
   - Licensing elimination: $200M saved
   - Operational efficiency: $150M saved
   - Migration prevention: $100M saved
   - Total direct: $950M

2. **Prevented Losses**
   - Data loss prevention: $300M value
   - Productivity gains: $200M
   - Research acceleration: $150M
   - Compliance costs: $50M
   - Total prevented: $700M

3. **New Value Creation**
   - Enabled research: $250M
   - Economic opportunities: $100M
   - Educational access: $50M
   - Cultural preservation: Priceless
   - Total new value: $400M+

### ROI Calculation
