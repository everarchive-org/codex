# Feature: 50+ Node Operator Network

**Feature ID**: 37  
**Category**: Economic Infrastructure / Network Sustainability  
**Status**: Validated  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

The 50+ Node Operator Network creates distributed economic participation opportunities where institutions, organizations, and dedicated individuals can contribute to global preservation infrastructure while earning sustainable returns. This feature transforms preservation from a cost center into an economic opportunity, aligning financial incentives with preservation mission.

Traditional preservation concentrates costs and control in single institutions. This distributed model spreads both the responsibility and rewards across a global network. Node operators earn returns for providing storage, bandwidth, and computational resources while strengthening the overall network's resilience. With 50+ operators across diverse geographies and institution types, no single point of failure can compromise preserved content.

For organizations with excess infrastructure capacity or mission alignment with preservation, becoming a node operator offers both financial returns and meaningful contribution to global knowledge preservation.

## Technical Details
