# Feature: Break-Even by Month 24

**Feature ID**: 38  
**Category**: Economic Infrastructure / Network Sustainability  
**Status**: Validated  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

Break-Even by Month 24 demonstrates the rapid path to financial sustainability through a carefully designed economic model that achieves operational self-sufficiency within two years. This feature represents more than a financial milestone - it validates the fundamental premise that critical preservation infrastructure can be both mission-driven and economically sustainable without compromising either goal.

Most infrastructure projects burn through funding for years before finding sustainability, if ever. Many never achieve break-even, depending on continuous fundraising or eventual acquisition. This aggressive timeline to break-even ensures EverArchive becomes self-sustaining quickly, reducing dependency on initial funding and proving the model for other critical infrastructure projects.

For stakeholders evaluating long-term viability, this rapid path to sustainability provides confidence that the infrastructure will endure regardless of funding trends or economic cycles.
