# Feature: $100M Endowment Model

**Feature ID**: 34  
**Category**: Economic Infrastructure / Institutional Economics  
**Status**: Validated  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

The $100M Endowment Model establishes century-scale non-profit sustainability through a permanent funding structure that ensures EverArchive infrastructure operates in perpetuity without depending on continued fundraising, commercial revenue, or subscription fees. This feature fundamentally reimagines how critical infrastructure should be funded - not through endless revenue seeking, but through sufficient one-time capitalization.

Traditional tech infrastructure depends on continuous growth and revenue extraction. When growth slows or markets shift, services shut down and preserved content vanishes. The major digital libraries faces constant financial pressure despite its critical mission. This endowment model creates true permanence by generating sufficient investment returns to cover all operational costs forever, removing the pressure to monetize or grow.

For creators and institutions trusting their legacy to EverArchive, this model provides the ultimate assurance: the infrastructure will outlive them, their institutions, and even current technological paradigms.
