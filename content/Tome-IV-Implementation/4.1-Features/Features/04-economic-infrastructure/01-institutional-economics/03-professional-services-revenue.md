# Feature: Professional Services Revenue

**Feature ID**: 35  
**Category**: Economic Infrastructure / Institutional Economics  
**Status**: Concept  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

Professional Services Revenue provides implementation consulting income through expert assistance helping institutions and large-scale creators successfully adopt EverArchive infrastructure. This feature creates a sustainable revenue stream that aligns perfectly with the mission - the more organizations successfully preserve their digital heritage, the more the infrastructure sustains itself.

Unlike software companies that profit from complexity and lock-in, these professional services focus on empowering clients to become self-sufficient. Revenue comes from accelerating successful adoption, not creating dependencies. Services include implementation planning, migration assistance, workflow optimization, staff training, and custom integration development.

For organizations seeking to transform their preservation capabilities, professional services provide the expertise and support needed to maximize value while minimizing implementation time and risk.
