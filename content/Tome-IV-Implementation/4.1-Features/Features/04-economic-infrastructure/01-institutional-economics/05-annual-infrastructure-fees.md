# Feature: Annual Infrastructure Fees

**Feature ID**: 40  
**Category**: Economic Infrastructure / Institutional Economics  
**Status**: Validated  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

Annual Infrastructure Fees provide predictable $10K-100K institutional subscriptions that support ongoing operations while delivering exceptional value compared to traditional preservation costs. This feature creates a sustainable revenue model that aligns with institutional budgeting cycles while maintaining the mission of affordable, universal preservation access.

Unlike per-user or per-GB pricing models that penalize growth and usage, infrastructure fees provide unlimited preservation and access within clear tiers based on institutional size and capacity. This predictable pricing enables institutions to budget confidently while accessing revolutionary preservation capabilities at a fraction of traditional costs.

For institutions seeking enterprise-grade preservation infrastructure with predictable costs and unlimited usage, these annual fees provide the perfect balance of sustainability and affordability.
