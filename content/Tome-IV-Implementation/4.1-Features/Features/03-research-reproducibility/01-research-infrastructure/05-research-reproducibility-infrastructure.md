# Feature: Research Reproducibility Infrastructure

**Feature ID**: 31  
**Category**: Research & Reproducibility / Research Infrastructure  
**Status**: Validated  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

Research Reproducibility Infrastructure provides complete context preservation for scientific studies, capturing not just data and code but the entire computational environment, dependencies, parameters, and decision-making process. This feature directly addresses the reproducibility crisis where 74% of researchers cannot reproduce their own work after just one year.

The scientific method depends on reproducibility, yet modern computational research has become so complex that even well-documented studies often cannot be recreated. Missing dependencies, version conflicts, undocumented parameters, and lost context turn groundbreaking research into unrepeatable events. This infrastructure captures everything needed to step into a researcher's exact environment at any point in time, making true reproducibility possible.

For researchers, this means confidence that their work will stand the test of time and scrutiny. For science, it means building on solid foundations rather than unrepeatable results.

## Technical Details

### How It Works

The system captures comprehensive research contexts:

1. **Environment Preservation**
   - Operating system state
   - Software versions and dependencies
   - Configuration files
   - Environment variables
   - Hardware specifications

2. **Process Documentation**
   - Command history
   - Parameter choices
   - Data transformations
   - Decision points
   - Error encounters

3. **Artifact Relationships**
   - Data lineage tracking
   - Code version linking
   - Output provenance
   - Documentation connections
   - Publication references

### Capture Methods
- Automatic environment scanning
- Container/VM snapshots
- Git integration for code
- Computational notebook preservation
- Workflow engine integration

### Reproduction Strategies
- One-click environment recreation
- Cloud-based reproduction
- Local container deployment
- Bare metal restoration
- Partial component replay
