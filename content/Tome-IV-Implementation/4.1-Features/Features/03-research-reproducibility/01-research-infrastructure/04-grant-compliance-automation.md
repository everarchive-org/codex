# Feature: Grant Compliance Automation

**Feature ID**: 30  
**Category**: Research & Reproducibility / Research Infrastructure  
**Status**: Concept  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

Grant Compliance Automation transforms the burdensome process of meeting funder data management requirements into an effortless, automated workflow. This feature ensures that researchers focus on science while the system handles the complex maze of preservation, reporting, and access requirements mandated by funding agencies.

Research grants increasingly require comprehensive data management plans, open access provisions, and long-term preservation strategies. Researchers often spend weeks preparing compliance documentation and months managing ongoing requirements. Non-compliance risks funding loss and future grant eligibility. This feature automates the entire compliance lifecycle, from initial data management plans through final reporting and perpetual access.

For researchers managing multiple grants with different requirements, this automation means compliance becomes invisible - happening automatically in the background while they focus on discoveries.

## Technical Details

### How It Works

The system automates compliance across the grant lifecycle:

1. **Funder Requirement Mapping**
   - NSF data management mandates
   - NIH public access policies
   - EU Horizon open science rules
   - Private foundation requirements
   - Agency-specific timelines

2. **Automated Workflows**
   - Data management plan generation
   - Automatic preservation triggers
   - Embargo period management
   - Public access coordination
   - Progress report compilation

3. **Compliance Tracking**
   - Requirement checklists
   - Timeline monitoring
   - Automated notifications
   - Audit trail generation
   - Report preparation

### Integration Capabilities
- Grant management systems
- Institutional repositories
- ORCID researcher IDs
- DOI registration
- Funder portals
- Publication platforms

### Automation Features
- Smart contract compliance rules
- Automatic metadata extraction
- Timeline-triggered actions
- Multi-grant coordination
- Exception handling

## Use Cases

### For Individual Researchers
- **NIH-Funded Scientist**: Data automatically preserved and made public after 12-month embargo
- **NSF Grant Recipient**: DMP requirements fulfilled automatically with quarterly reports
- **EU Researcher**: Horizon Europe open science mandates met without manual intervention
- **Multi-Grant PI**: Different requirements across 5 grants managed seamlessly

### For Research Teams
- **Large Collaboration**: 50-person team compliance coordinated automatically
- **International Project**: Different national requirements harmonized
- **Longitudinal Study**: 10-year preservation and access requirements automated
- **Clinical Trial**: Patient data compliance with automatic redaction

### For Institutions
- **Research Office**: University-wide compliance monitoring dashboard
- **Sponsored Programs**: Automated reporting to all funders
- **Library Services**: Repository integration with compliance tracking
- **Audit Preparation**: Complete documentation instantly available

- Authentication systems

## Data & Evidence

### Supporting Research
- Researcher survey: 15% of time spent on compliance
- Audit findings: 34% of grants have compliance issues
- Cost analysis: $50K average per grant on compliance
- Automation potential: 90% of requirements automatable
- ROI projection: 10x return through time savings

### Metrics
- Requirements mapped: 250+ across 15 funders

## FAQ

### Common Questions

1. **Q**: How does it know each funder's requirements?
   **A**: Continuously updated database of funder policies with automatic interpretation and rule generation.

2. **Q**: What if requirements change mid-grant?
   **A**: System monitors policy changes and automatically adjusts workflows with notifications of significant changes.

3. **Q**: Can it handle custom institutional requirements?
   **A**: Yes. Institution-specific rules layer on top of funder requirements.

4. **Q**: How does it prove compliance for audits?
   **A**: Complete audit trail with timestamps, actions, and documentation instantly available.
