# Feature: Library ILS Integration

**Feature ID**: 33  
**Category**: Research & Reproducibility / Institutional Integration  
**Status**: Validated  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

Library ILS Integration ensures seamless compatibility with existing Integrated Library Systems, allowing libraries to adopt EverArchive's revolutionary preservation capabilities without disrupting their core cataloging, discovery, and circulation workflows. This feature recognizes that ILS systems are the operational backbone of libraries, often representing decades of investment in metadata, workflows, and staff expertise.

Modern libraries operate through their ILS - whether Alma, FOLIO, Koha, or legacy systems like Voyager and Symphony. These systems manage everything from cataloging to patron access. Requiring libraries to abandon their ILS for preservation would be like asking them to abandon their entire operational infrastructure. This feature provides deep, bidirectional integration that enhances rather than replaces existing systems.

For libraries seeking blockchain preservation benefits without operational disruption, this integration provides a seamless bridge between traditional library science and future-proof preservation technology.

## Technical Details

### How It Works

The integration operates through multiple connection methods:

1. **API Integration Layer**
   - RESTful APIs for modern ILS
   - Z39.50 for legacy systems
   - SIP2 for circulation
   - OAI-PMH for harvesting
   - NCIP for consortial sharing

2. **Metadata Synchronization**
   - Real-time MARC record updates
   - Holdings synchronization
   - Authority control integration
   - Subject heading mapping
   - Local field preservation

3. **Workflow Integration**
   - Cataloging plugin modules
   - Acquisition triggers
   - Preservation queues
   - Access management
   - Reports integration

### Supported Systems
- **Modern Cloud**: Ex Libris Alma, OCLC WorldShare
- **Open Source**: FOLIO, Koha, Evergreen
- **Legacy**: Voyager, Symphony, Millennium
- **Specialized**: ArchivesSpace, DSpace
- **Consortial**: Shared catalogs and union lists

### Integration Features
- Automatic metadata crosswalking
- Batch import/export tools
- Real-time status updates
- Preservation dashboard widgets
- Unified search interfaces

## Use Cases

### For Academic Libraries
- **Research University**: Alma integration preserves all digital acquisitions automatically
- **Community College**: Koha workflow adds blockchain preservation to cataloging
- **Consortium Members**: Shared FOLIO instance coordinates preservation
- **Special Collections**: ArchivesSpace to EverArchive pipeline for manuscripts

### For Public Libraries
- **Urban System**: Polaris integration enables patron access to preserved materials
- **Rural Library**: SirsiDynix preservation queue for local history
- **State Network**: Shared catalog includes preservation status
- **Branch Libraries**: Simplified workflows through ILS integration

### For Special Libraries
- **Law Libraries**: Preservation integrated with specialized legal ILS
- **Medical Libraries**: DOCLINE integration for preserved materials
- **Museum Libraries**: TMS to ILS to preservation pipeline
- **Corporate Libraries**: Custom ILS preservation workflows

## FAQ

### Common Questions

1. **Q**: Will this slow down our ILS?
   **A**: No. Asynchronous processing ensures no impact on ILS performance.

2. **Q**: Do we need to change our cataloging practices?
   **A**: No. Existing practices continue with preservation happening automatically.

3. **Q**: What if we change ILS vendors?
   **A**: Standard protocols ensure easy migration to new ILS systems.

4. **Q**: Can we customize the integration?
   **A**: Yes. Flexible configuration for local workflows and policies.
