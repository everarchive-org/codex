# Feature: Smart Contract Licensing

**Feature ID**: 48  
**Category**: Legal & Rights / Rights Infrastructure  
**Status**: Proven  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

Smart Contract Licensing revolutionizes creative rights management through automated terms enforcement that eliminates intermediaries, reduces transaction costs, and ensures creators receive fair compensation instantly. This feature transforms licensing from a complex legal process into seamless automated transactions that benefit both creators and users.

Traditional licensing involves lawyers, negotiations, paperwork, and delayed payments. A simple image license might take weeks and cost hundreds in legal fees. Smart contracts encode license terms into self-executing code that handles permissions, payments, and usage tracking automatically. This reduces friction to near-zero while ensuring all parties' rights are protected.

For creators seeking to monetize their work fairly and users needing quick, legal access to creative content, smart contract licensing provides the perfect solution that scales from individual transactions to enterprise agreements.
