# Feature: Rights-Aware Scheduling

**Feature ID**: 44  
**Category**: Legal & Rights / Rights Infrastructure  
**Status**: Concept  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

Rights-Aware Scheduling automatically manages the complex timeline of intellectual property rights, enabling seamless transitions to public domain, embargo expirations, and rights reversions. This feature transforms rights management from a manual, error-prone process into an intelligent system that maximizes both creator rights and public access.

Traditional rights management requires constant vigilance - tracking expiration dates, managing embargoes, processing public domain transitions, and handling geographic variations. Mistakes can mean lawsuits or lost opportunities. This feature automates the entire lifecycle, ensuring creators maintain control during protection periods while guaranteeing public access the moment rights expire.

For creators planning their legacy and institutions managing vast collections, automated rights scheduling provides peace of mind that intellectual property will be handled correctly across decades and centuries.

## Technical Details

### How It Works

The system manages rights through intelligent automation:

1. **Rights Timeline Tracking**
   - Copyright term calculation
   - Embargo period management  
   - License expiration monitoring
   - Geographic variation handling
   - Reversion right triggers

2. **Automated Transitions**
   - Public domain release
   - Embargo lifting
   - License activation/deactivation
   - Access control updates
   - Notification systems

3. **Complex Scenarios**
   - Life + 70 years calculations
   - Work-for-hire distinctions
   - Joint authorship rules
   - International variations
   - Orphan work protocols

### Rights Intelligence
- Jurisdiction-aware rules engine
- Death record integration
- Legal change monitoring
- Retroactive adjustment capability
- Audit trail maintenance

### Scheduling Capabilities
- Multi-decade planning
- Conditional triggers
- Batch processing
- Exception handling
- Manual override options

## Use Cases

### For Individual Creators
- **Author Estate**: Novel enters public domain exactly 70 years after project completion
- **Musician**: Recordings release to public domain per jurisdiction
- **Academic**: Research embargoes lift automatically after patent filing
- **Artist**: Limited editions expire and become freely available
- **Photographer**: Commercial exclusivity transitions to open access

### For Institutions
- **Libraries**: Manage thousands of works with varying rights
- **Archives**: Process collections with complex provenance
- **Museums**: Handle artist estates and donation agreements
- **Universities**: Coordinate faculty research and student works

### For Publishers
- **Reversion Rights**: Authors regain rights after out-of-print periods
- **Territory Management**: Different rights per country/region
- **Edition Control**: Hardcover vs paperback vs digital timing
- **Translation Rights**: Language-specific scheduling

## Benefits & Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- Eliminated manual tracking
- Reduced legal risk
- Maximized access
- Honored creator intent
- Simplified management

### Long-term Impact
- Expanded public domain
