# Feature: Fair Use Documentation

**Feature ID**: 50  
**Category**: Legal & Rights / Rights Infrastructure  
**Status**: Concept  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

Fair Use Documentation provides educational exemption support through comprehensive metadata, usage tracking, and legal documentation that helps institutions and educators confidently exercise fair use rights while maintaining defensible records. This feature transforms the anxiety-inducing process of fair use determination into a systematic, documented approach that stands up to legal scrutiny.

Fair use remains one of the most important yet misunderstood aspects of copyright law. Educational institutions often err on the side of extreme caution, denying students and researchers access to materials that could legally be used. This feature provides tools for fair use analysis, automatic documentation generation, and usage tracking that creates a clear record supporting educational exemptions.

For educators navigating copyright complexity and institutions managing risk, this documentation system provides the confidence to fully utilize fair use provisions while maintaining legal compliance.
