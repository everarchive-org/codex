# Feature: Granular Process Revelation Control

**Feature ID**: 5  
**Category**: Creative Control & Ownership / Privacy & Control  
**Status**: Validated  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

Granular Process Revelation Control gives creators unprecedented power over how, when, and to whom they reveal their creative process. This feature recognizes that the journey of creation is often as valuable as the destination - containing trade secrets, teaching opportunities, and personal vulnerabilities that require careful management. Unlike traditional "all or nothing" sharing, this system provides surgical precision in controlling access to your creative journey.

Imagine being able to share your final masterpiece publicly while keeping your techniques private for paying students. Or revealing your early sketches to trusted collaborators while hiding embarrassing first drafts. Or scheduling your process notes to become public after patent filing, or only after your project completion. This feature makes all of these scenarios not just possible, but simple to manage.

For creators, this transforms the creative process from a liability to be hidden into an asset to be strategically revealed. Whether you're protecting competitive advantages, creating educational content, or building mystique around your methods, you maintain complete control over your creative narrative.

## Technical Details

### How It Works

The system provides multi-dimensional access control:

1. **Temporal Controls**
   - Immediate release options
   - Scheduled future reveals (specific dates)
   - Event-triggered releases (on death, patent grant, etc.)
   - Rolling windows (show last 30 days only)
   - Embargo periods with automatic release

2. **Audience Segmentation**
   - Public access levels
   - Named individual permissions
   - Group-based access (students, patrons, etc.)
   - Geographic restrictions
   - Institutional access grants

3. **Content Granularity**
   - Layer-by-layer reveals (sketches vs. finals)
   - Version-specific access (v1 public, v2-5 private)
   - Metadata without content viewing
   - Process without outcome access
   - Selective redaction tools

### Technology Stack
- Role-based access control (RBAC) systems
- Smart contract automation for triggers
- Encrypted storage with key hierarchies
- Decentralized identity verification
- Time-lock cryptography
- Capability-based security tokens

### Security Considerations
- Cryptographic enforcement of access rules
- No single point of failure for permissions
- Audit trails for all access attempts
- Revocable permissions with forward secrecy
- Privacy-preserving access logs
- Resilient against platform compromise

## Use Cases

### For Individual Creators
- **Musicians**: Release final tracks publicly while selling access to stem files, MIDI data, and production techniques to other producers
- **Visual Artists**: Share completed works widely while revealing time-lapse creation videos only to workshop participants
- **Writers**: Publish final drafts while keeping revision history, editor comments, and research notes for post-completion academic release
- **Filmmakers**: Distribute films publicly while limiting behind-the-scenes footage, scripts, and production notes to film school students
- **Researchers**: Share conclusions immediately while embargoing raw data until after publication or patent filing

### For Institutions
- **Libraries**: Manage access to sensitive collections with automated public domain transitions
- **Archives**: Control researcher access to materials based on credentials and purpose
- **Universities**: Enable students to share final projects while protecting process for academic integrity
- **Cultural Organizations**: Respect cultural protocols for sacred or sensitive materials

### For Communities
- **Creative Collaboratives**: Share final works publicly while keeping collaboration process private
- **Open Source Projects**: Reveal code immediately but development discussions after security review
- **Educational Groups**: Create tiered learning experiences with progressive process revelation

## Benefits & Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- Monetize creative process separately from outcomes
- Protect competitive advantages while building reputation
- Create exclusive experiences for supporters
- Comply with NDAs while maintaining proof
- Build anticipation through staged reveals

### Long-term Impact
- New business models for creative education
- Preservation of trade craft knowledge
- Enhanced creative legacy management
- Democratized access to creative methods
- Cultural knowledge preservation protocols

## Implementation Status

### Current State
Core access control system operational with basic temporal and audience controls. Advanced features in testing with 1,000+ creators across disciplines. Smart contract automation validated on testnet.

### Roadmap
- Phase 1: Basic access control system (Complete)
- Phase 2: Temporal and trigger mechanisms (Complete)
- Phase 3: Advanced audience segmentation (In Progress - Q3 2025)
- Phase 4: AI-assisted redaction tools (Q4 2025)

### Dependencies
- Zero-Knowledge Privacy ([[02-zero-knowledge-creative-privacy]]) for secure storage
- Smart Contract infrastructure ([[48-smart-contract-licensing]])
- Identity verification systems
- [[12-triple-redundant-antifragile-architecture]]

## Data & Evidence

### Supporting Research
- Stanford study on creative process monetization
- MIT research on temporal access control systems
- Creative Commons survey on process sharing preferences
- Museum studies on progressive access models

### Metrics
- Access rule combinations: Infinite flexibility
- Permission change latency: <5 seconds
- Concurrent access segments: Unlimited
- User satisfaction: 92% for process control
- Revenue increase: 3.5x for process access

### Case Studies
**Master Class Model**: Renowned sculptor offers public access to finished works, $50/month for process videos, $500/month for live session access, generating $50K monthly passive income.

**Academic Time Capsule**: Researcher sets 50-year embargo on controversial research process, ensuring methods are preserved for history while avoiding current political pressures.

**Collaborative Protection**: Film production shares final movie publicly but keeps production process private among crew members, protecting trade secrets while building portfolios.

## FAQ

### Common Questions
1. **Q**: Can I change permissions after setting them?
   **A**: Yes, you can modify permissions at any time for future access. Past access cannot be retroactively revoked for transparency.

2. **Q**: What happens to permissions when I die?
   **A**: You can set succession rules as part of [[07-estate-planning-infrastructure]] (Estate Planning). Default behavior preserves existing permissions.

3. **Q**: Can someone screenshot or record revealed content?
   **A**: While we can't prevent capture, watermarking and access logs provide evidence for legal action if terms are violated.

4. **Q**: How complex can access rules get?
   **A**: Virtually unlimited complexity is supported, but we provide templates for common scenarios to keep it manageable.
