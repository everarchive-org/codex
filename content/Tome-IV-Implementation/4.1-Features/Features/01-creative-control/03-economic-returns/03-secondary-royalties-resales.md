# Feature: Secondary Royalties on Resales

**Feature ID**: 10  
**Category**: Creative Control & Ownership / Economic Returns  
**Status**: Proven  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

Secondary Royalties on Resales ensures creators receive 5-10% of all future sales of their work in perpetuity, implementing the artist's resale right digitally and automatically. This feature addresses a fundamental inequity in creative markets where creators typically receive payment only once, while their works can appreciate dramatically in secondary markets without any benefit flowing back to the original creator.

Consider the painful reality: an artist sells a painting for $1,000 to survive, only to watch it resell for $100,000 years later without receiving a penny. A first edition book sold for cover price becomes a valuable collectible. Early digital art purchased for hundreds now trades for millions. This feature ensures creators participate in the long-term value appreciation of their work through automatic, blockchain-enforced royalty payments.

For creators, this transforms every sale from a one-time transaction into a potential lifetime income stream. It incentivizes creating lasting, quality work and rewards creators whose reputations grow over time. Most importantly, it recognizes that creative value often increases with cultural significance and scarcity - and creators deserve to benefit from that appreciation.

## Technical Details

### How It Works

The system enforces secondary royalties through:

1. **Smart Contract Enforcement**
   - Royalty logic embedded in asset metadata
   - Automatic payment splitting on transfer
   - Non-circumventable payment rules
   - Cross-marketplace compatibility
   - Inheritance of royalty rights

2. **Royalty Mechanisms**
   - Fixed percentage models (5-10%)
   - Sliding scale based on sale price
   - Minimum threshold settings
   - Geographic compliance variations
   - Multiple beneficiary support

3. **Market Integration**
   - Universal royalty standard adoption
   - Marketplace enforcement requirements
   - Off-chain sale reporting incentives
   - Legacy asset migration paths
   - Cross-chain royalty bridging

### Technology Stack
- ERC-2981 royalty standard implementation
- Smart contract automation
- Cross-marketplace protocols
- Oracle price verification
- Multi-chain synchronization
- IPFS metadata permanence

### Security Considerations
- Cryptographic enforcement of royalties
- Anti-circumvention mechanisms
- Marketplace verification requirements
- Fraud detection systems
- Immutable royalty records
- Legal framework integration

## Use Cases

### For Individual Creators
- **Musicians**: Earn from vinyl records becoming collectibles, limited edition releases appreciating, and rare recordings gaining cultural value
- **Visual Artists**: Receive payment when early works bought cheaply become valuable as reputation grows, ensuring success benefits the creator
- **Writers**: Benefit when first editions and signed copies appreciate in value, creating ongoing income from successful works
- **Filmmakers**: Participate in value appreciation of limited releases, director's cuts, and culturally significant films
- **Researchers**: Gain from historical papers becoming valuable as fields develop and early insights prove prescient

### For Institutions
- **Libraries**: Structure acquisition programs that support creators long-term while building collections
- **Archives**: Create sustainable funding models for living artists through collection appreciation
- **Universities**: Enable faculty to benefit from long-term impact of their creative work
- **Cultural Organizations**: Support artists throughout careers, not just at point of acquisition

### For Communities
- **Creative Collaboratives**: Share in collective success as group works appreciate
- **Open Source Projects**: Fund ongoing development through appreciation of early versions
- **Educational Groups**: Create sustainable funding through educational material value growth

## FAQ

### Common Questions
1. **Q**: Can buyers avoid paying secondary royalties?
   **A**: Smart contract enforcement makes circumvention extremely difficult. Marketplaces that don't honor royalties lose access to creators and collectors.

   **A**: Royalty rights can be inherited like any other asset, providing ongoing support for creator estates and beneficiaries.

3. **Q**: Do royalties apply to private sales?
   **A**: The system incentivizes reporting private sales for provenance tracking. Some jurisdictions legally require royalty payment regardless of sale method.

4. **Q**: Can royalty percentages be changed?
   **A**: Generally no - royalty terms are set at creation to provide certainty for all parties. Some implementations allow creator-initiated reductions only.
