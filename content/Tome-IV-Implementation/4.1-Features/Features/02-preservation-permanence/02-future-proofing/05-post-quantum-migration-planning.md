# Feature: Post-Quantum Migration Planning

**Feature ID**: 18  
**Category**: Preservation & Permanence / Future-Proofing  
**Status**: Validated  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

Post-Quantum Migration Planning provides comprehensive cryptography implementation pathways that ensure smooth transitions as quantum computing threats emerge and evolve. Unlike simple algorithm swaps, this feature orchestrates the complex dance of maintaining security, compatibility, and accessibility while fundamental cryptographic assumptions change beneath our feet.

The quantum threat isn't binary - it's a gradual erosion of classical cryptography's effectiveness. Different algorithms will fall at different times to different quantum capabilities. This feature implements intelligent migration orchestration that monitors threat evolution, plans transitions proactively, and executes migrations seamlessly while maintaining zero downtime and complete backward compatibility.

For long-term preservation, this means creative works remain protected not just against today's quantum computers, but against the entire spectrum of quantum advancement over the coming century.

## Technical Details

### How It Works

The system implements adaptive migration intelligence:

1. **Threat Monitoring Framework**
   - Quantum capability tracking
   - Algorithm vulnerability assessment
   - Timeline projection models
   - Risk scoring systems
   - Early warning indicators

2. **Migration Orchestration**
   - Staged algorithm transitions
   - Compatibility layer management
   - Performance optimization paths
   - Resource allocation planning
   - Rollback capabilities

3. **Implementation Phases**
   - 2025-2028: Hybrid classical/quantum
   - 2028-2032: First quantum transitions
   - 2032-2040: Full post-quantum
   - 2040-2050: Next-generation quantum
   - 2050+: Continuous evolution
