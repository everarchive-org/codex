# Feature: Consortium Support Infrastructure

**Feature ID**: 65  
**Category**: Library & Book Ecosystem / Lending Infrastructure  
**Status**: Concept  
**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025

## Overview

Consortium Support Infrastructure enables multiple libraries to share digital collections through blockchain-verified lending, allowing patron access to expanded collections while maintaining individual library control and fair cost sharing. This system supports both formal consortiums and informal sharing agreements between libraries.

## Technical Details

### Consortium Management
- **Shared Collections**: Cross-library access to digital books
- **Fair Use Allocation**: Usage-based cost sharing
- **Permission Controls**: Library-specific access policies
- **Billing Integration**: Automated cost distribution

### Cross-Library Features
- **Unified Discovery**: Search across consortium collections
- **Reciprocal Borrowing**: Use any member library card
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute usage across members
- **Resource Sharing**: Optimize collection overlap

## Implementation

### Current State
Conceptual design based on existing consortium models. Technical architecture ready for pilot implementation with interested library consortiums.

### Planned Features
- Multi-library smart contracts
- Cross-system authentication
- Shared collection analytics
- Fair usage algorithms

## Benefits

### For Libraries
- **Expanded Collections**: Access to member libraries' books
- **Cost Sharing**: Spread acquisition costs across members
- **Resource Optimization**: Reduce duplicate purchases
- **Collaborative Power**: Negotiate better with publishers

### For Patrons
- **Larger Collections**: More books available
- **Consistent Access**: Same experience across libraries
- **Reduced Holds**: More copies across consortium
- **Regional Access**: Borrow from any member library
