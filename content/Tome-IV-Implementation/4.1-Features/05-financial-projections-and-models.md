# EverArchive Infrastructure Sustainability Model

**Document ID:** FIN-SUS-1.0
**Version:** 1.0 (Infrastructure Sustainability)
**Date:** 2025-06-23
**Status:** Canonical Reference

**CRITICAL CONTEXT**: EverArchive doesn't touch money. This document models how infrastructure operations are sustained through grants, support agreements, and endowmentâ€”not revenue generation.

---

### **Preamble**

This document presents infrastructure sustainability planning for EverArchive's first 10 years of operations, including operational cost projections, funding sources, endowment growth scenarios, and resilience analyses. These projections are based on comparable non-profit infrastructure organizations and conservative assumptions about operational requirements.

### **Conclusion: A Sustainable Financial Future**

These financial projections demonstrate that EverArchive's economic model is both ambitious and achievable. With validated revenue assumptions, conservative expense budgeting, and a clear path to a $100M endowment, the organization can achieve permanent sustainability while fulfilling its mission of preserving humanity's creative legacy.

The keys to financial success are:
1. Disciplined execution of the partnership revenue model
2. Careful management of expenses during growth
3. Successful capital campaigns for endowment building
4. Diversification across multiple revenue streams
5. Maintaining non-profit efficiency standards

With these elements in place, EverArchive will transition from grant-dependent startup to self-sustaining institution, ensuring that our preservation mission continues not just for decades, but for centuries to come.
