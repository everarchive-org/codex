**Date:** 2025-06-19
**Status:** Canonical Reference

### **Preamble**

We, the founding community and initial stewards of the EverArchive, in order to form a more perfect and permanent union for the preservation of human creative memory; to establish a just, transparent, and resilient system of governance; to protect the sovereignty of every creator; to guard against the forces of centralization and extraction; and to secure the blessings of our collective heritage for ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the EverArchive initiative.

This Constitution provides the framework by which a distributed, global community shall govern a resource intended to last forever. Its authority is derived from the consent of its participants and its adherence to the core principles upon which the EverArchive is built.

---

### **Article I: Inviolable Principles**

The powers and processes defined herein are at all times subordinate to the following core principles. Any proposal, amendment, or action that violates these principles shall be considered null and void.

1.  **Creator Sovereignty:** The creator of a work holds ultimate and inalienable control over the access, use, and legacy of their own creative memory. The system must provide the tools to enforce this sovereignty, especially over the private **Core Layer**.
2.  **Permanence & Preservation:** The primary, overriding mission is the perpetual preservation of archived works and their context. All decisions must be weighed against their impact on the long-term survival and integrity of the archive.
3.  **Decentralization & Anti-Capture:** The EverArchive must resist capture by any single corporate, state, or private entity. Governance and infrastructure shall be distributed to prevent single points of failure or control.
4.  **Non-Extraction:** The EverArchive is a public good, not a commercial enterprise. Its economic models must serve the mission of sustainability, not the generation of profit for shareholders.
5.  **Transparency:** All governance processes, decisions, and financial records shall be public, auditable, and recorded permanently within the archive itself.
6.  **Openness:** All core protocols, formats (such as the Deep Authorship Package specification), and reference software implementations shall be open-source to foster a collaborative, resilient, and interoperable ecosystem.

### **Article II: The EverArchive Assembly**

#### **Section 1: Purpose & Authority**

The EverArchive Assembly (henceforth "the Assembly") is the highest governing body of the initiative. It is responsible for strategic oversight, ratification of major proposals, and serving as the final arbiter in disputes. It legislates for the long-term health of the ecosystem, delegating day-to-day operations to the Working Groups.

#### **Section 2: Composition & Representation**

The Assembly shall be composed of elected representatives from the core stakeholder communities to ensure a balance of power and perspectives. The initial composition shall be:

*   **Creator Caucus (3 seats):** Elected by and from verified creators with works in the archive.
*   **Steward Caucus (3 seats):** Elected by and from certified community stewards responsible for technical and cultural maintenance.
*   **Institutional Partner Caucus (3 seats):** Elected by and from representatives of partner museums, libraries, and archives.
*   **Ecosystem Developer Caucus (2 seats):** Elected by and from developers who actively contribute to the open-source tools and protocols.
*   **Public/User Caucus (1 seat):** Elected by and from the general user community to represent the public interest.

The size and composition of the Assembly may be altered via the Amendment process defined in Article VI.

#### **Section 3: Elections & Terms**

1.  **Elections:** Each caucus shall define and manage its own secure, transparent election process.
2.  **Term Length:** Assembly members shall serve a term of **three (3) years**.
3.  **Staggered Terms:** To ensure continuity, one-third of the Assembly seats shall be up for election each year.
4.  **Term Limits:** No individual may serve more than two (2) consecutive terms on the Assembly without a mandatory one-term break.

The following Working Groups are established by this Constitution:

1.  **Technical Standards Group:** Oversees the Deep Authorship Package specification, the Canonical API, and all core technical protocols.

5.  **Discovery & Access Group:** Oversees the evolution of the Discovery Infrastructure, including the Schema Projector and search algorithms.

#### **Section 3: Membership & Leadership**

1.  **Membership:** Any community member with demonstrated expertise and commitment may apply to join a Working Group.

### **Article IV: The EverArchive Proposal System (EAPS)**

#### **Section 1: The Lifecycle of a Decision**

All formal changes to the EverArchive protocols, policies, or this Constitution must follow the EAPS, ensuring transparency and community input.

1.  **Phase 1: Idea & Discussion:** An idea is informally discussed in community forums.
2.  **Phase 2: Draft Proposal (EAP):** A formal proposal is written using a standard template and submitted to the relevant Working Group.
3.  **Phase 3: Working Group Review:** The assigned Working Group reviews the EAP for technical feasibility, ethical alignment, and resource impact, providing a formal recommendation.
4.  **Phase 4: Community Comment Period:** The EAP and the Working Group's recommendation are opened for a public comment period of no less than 28 days.
5.  **Phase 5: Assembly Vote:** The EAP, recommendation, and a summary of community feedback are presented to the Assembly for a vote. A simple majority (50%+1) is required for most proposals.
6.  **Phase 6: Ratification or Rejection:** The final decision is recorded permanently on-chain and in the public governance record.

#### **Section 2: Proposal Types**

*   **Constitutional Amendment:** A proposal to change this Constitution. Requires a two-thirds (67%) supermajority vote of the Assembly.
*   **Protocol Change:** A proposal to change a core technical standard (e.g., the Deep Authorship Package spec). Requires approval from the Technical Standards Group before proceeding to an Assembly vote.
*   **Policy Change:** A proposal to change an operational policy (e.g., partnership requirements). Can be ratified by the relevant Working Group, with the Assembly holding veto power.

### **Article V: Dispute Resolution Framework**

#### **Section 1: Guiding Principles**

The dispute resolution process shall be guided by principles of restorative justice, aiming to mend relationships and find common ground, rather than assign blame. The process is designed to be fair, transparent, and accessible to all community members.

#### **Section 2: The Ladder of Resolution**

Conflicts should be resolved at the lowest possible level.

1.  **Step 1: Direct Communication:** Parties are encouraged to resolve disputes directly in a spirit of mutual respect.
2.  **Step 2: Community Mediation:** If direct communication fails, parties may request a certified community mediator to facilitate a conversation.
3.  **Step 3: Working Group Adjudication:** If the dispute relates to a specific policy or technical standard, the relevant Working Group will hear the case and issue a binding recommendation.
4.  **Step 4: Assembly Arbitration:** As a final resort, disputes of critical importance to the ecosystem may be appealed to the Assembly. The Assembly's decision is final and binding within the EverArchive ecosystem.

### **Article VI: The Amendment Process**

#### **Section 1: Proposing an Amendment**

Any member of the community may draft a proposal to amend this Constitution. To be formally considered, a proposal must be sponsored by at least three (3) members of the Assembly from at least two (2) different caucuses.

#### **Section 2: Ratification**

1.  The proposed amendment must follow the complete EAPS lifecycle (Article IV).
2.  A successful vote requires a **two-thirds (67%) supermajority** of the entire Assembly.
3.  Following a successful vote, there shall be a 90-day "Community Reflection Period" before the amendment is formally ratified and takes effect. During this period, the Assembly may, with a simple majority vote, call for a re-vote if significant new concerns emerge.
4.  The ratification of the amendment shall be recorded as an immutable transaction on the EverArchive's governance chain.
