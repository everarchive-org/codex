# EverArchive Technical Evolution Framework

**Document ID:** TEF-1.0
**Version:** 1.0 (Ratification Draft)
**Date:** 2025-06-19
**Status:** Canonical Reference

### **Preamble**

Permanence in a digital world is not a state of static immutability, but a process of continuous, managed evolution. Technology is not a constant; it is a river. To build an ark that lasts forever, one cannot anchor it to the riverbed of today's technology. One must build it to navigate the currents of tomorrow. This Framework provides the principles, protocols, and governance for ensuring the EverArchive's technical infrastructure can evolve across generations while preserving the bit-level integrity and semantic meaning of its contents.

### **Article I: Core Principles of Technical Evolution**

1.  **Preservation of Meaning over Format:** The primary goal is to preserve the meaning, context, and experience of a creative work. The file format is merely a temporary vessel for that meaning.
2.  **Backward Compatibility as a Moral Imperative:** All new systems and formats must, to the greatest extent possible, be able to interpret and render objects created with older versions. The burden of compatibility rests on the new system, not the old data.
3.  **Controlled, Not Constant, Change:** Evolution is necessary, but instability is a threat. Upgrades to core protocols shall be infrequent, well-tested, and governed by a rigorous community process.
4.  **Emulation as a Last Resort, Migration as a Primary Strategy:** While we will preserve the tools to emulate old environments, our primary strategy is the proactive migration of content to new, open, and more durable formats.
5.  **Open Standards as Bedrock:** The ecosystem will always be built upon open, well-documented standards to avoid vendor lock-in and ensure future developers can understand and build upon our work.

### **Article II: Format Evolution Protocol**

This protocol governs the lifecycle of all file formats within the EverArchive.

#### **Section 1: The Format Registry**

The Technical Standards Group shall maintain a **Format Registry**, a public database of all file formats present in the archive. Each entry will include:
*   **Format ID:** (e.g., `image/jpeg`, `video/mp4`)
*   **Specification Document:** A link to its official technical specification.
*   **Obsolescence Risk Score:** A dynamically updated score (0.0 to 1.0) based on factors like open-source support, market usage, and hardware dependencies.
*   **Recommended Migration Path(s):** The preferred target format(s) for future conversion.
*   **Preservation Quality:** The designated quality for archival copies (e.g., TIFF for images, FLAC for audio).

#### **Section 2: The Obsolescence Warning System**

The Watchtower Protocol (defined in `RRP-1.0`) will monitor the Format Registry.
*   **Yellow Alert (Risk Score > 0.5):** The Technical Standards Group is tasked with researching and proposing a migration strategy.
*   **Orange Alert (Risk Score > 0.7):** A formal EAP is submitted to the Assembly to ratify the migration plan and allocate resources.
*   **Red Alert (Risk Score > 0.9):** The format is considered "At-Risk." Active, automated migration of all instances of this format becomes a high-priority operational task.

#### **Section 3: The Migration Process**

1.  **Tool Development:** The Ecosystem Developer community builds or adopts open-source tools for converting the source format to the target format.
2.  **Semantic Validation:** The conversion process is not merely technical. It must be validated against a "semantic checklist" to ensure that no essential meaning or context is lost. For example, migrating a layered image format must preserve the layer structure, not just the flattened image.
3.  **Parallel Storage:** The newly converted file is added to the relevant Deep Authorship Package object as a new `surface/` or `process/` file. **The original file is never deleted.** It is preserved alongside the new version to maintain a complete historical and technical lineage.
4.  **Index Update:** The Forever Sites Index is updated to recognize the new format as the preferred access copy.

### **Article III: Software & System Evolution Protocol**

This protocol governs upgrades to EverArchive's own software and infrastructure (e.g., Capture Tools, Discovery Engine, Canonical API).

#### **Section 1: Semantic Versioning**

All software will adhere to [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/).
*   **MAJOR version (e.g., 2.0.0):** Indicates a breaking change to the API or Deep Authorship Package format. Requires a formal EAP and Assembly ratification.
*   **MINOR version (e.g., 1.2.0):** Indicates new, backward-compatible functionality. Can be approved by the relevant Working Group.
*   **PATCH version (e.g., 1.1.1):** Indicates backward-compatible bug fixes. Can be deployed by the development team directly.

#### **Section 2: The Upgrade & Deployment Process**

Upgrades to critical infrastructure must be executed with zero downtime and maximum safety.
1.  **Proposal:** All MAJOR and MINOR version changes must be proposed via the EAPS.
2.  **Development:** Changes are developed in a separate branch. All code must be peer-reviewed and have >90% test coverage.
3.  **Staging Environment:** The upgrade is first deployed to a staging environment that mirrors the production system. It must run successfully for at least 30 days under simulated load.
4.  **Blue-Green Deployment:** The upgrade is deployed to the "green" (inactive) production environment.
5.  **Canary Release:** A small percentage of traffic (e.g., 1%) is routed to the new version. Health metrics are monitored closely.
6.  **Gradual Rollout:** If the canary release is stable, traffic is gradually shifted to the new version over a period of days or weeks.
7.  **Full Transition:** Once 100% of traffic is on the new version, the old "blue" environment becomes the new inactive environment, ready for the next upgrade.

#### **Section 3: The Deep Authorship Package Specification Evolution**

The Deep Authorship Package specification is the most sacred technical artifact.
*   **Frequency:** It is intended to undergo a MAJOR version change no more than **once per decade**.
*   **Process:** Any change to the Deep Authorship Package spec requires a Constitutional Amendment-level process (two-thirds supermajority vote of the Assembly).
*   **Migration:** Any new version of the Capture Tool must be able to read all previous versions of Deep Authorship Package objects. It may optionally offer a non-destructive process to upgrade an old Deep Authorship Package to the new version by adding new files and updating the `manifest.json`, while preserving all original data.

### **Article IV: Hardware & Infrastructure Evolution**

#### **Section 1: The Principle of Abstraction**

The EverArchive software stack is designed to be abstracted from the underlying hardware. We do not depend on specific server models or chip architectures. Our commitment is to open protocols (like TCP/IP) and containerization technologies (like Docker/Wasm) that allow the system to run on any future commodity hardware.

#### **Section 2: Physical Vault Media Evolution**

The contents of the physical vaults represent our ultimate backup. The media within them must also evolve.
*   **Review Cycle:** Every **20 years**, the Technical Standards Group will conduct a formal review of the state-of-the-art in long-term physical media.
*   **Migration Criteria:** A new medium will be adopted if it offers at least a 10x improvement in data density, a 2x improvement in estimated longevity, or provides a critical new resilience feature (e.g., resistance to a new environmental threat).
*   **Migration Process:** Data will be retrieved from a subset of vaults, copied to the new media, verified, and then distributed to a new set of vaults. The old media will be retained until the new media's reliability is proven over at least one review cycle.

### **Conclusion: A Framework for Change**

This framework establishes that the technical foundation of EverArchive is not a static monolith, but a dynamic, living system. By creating clear, community-governed protocols for managing change, we ensure that the archive can adapt to an unknowable future. This ability to evolve is the key to achieving true, lasting permanence. It is how we build a system that is not only built *for* forever, but can also be rebuilt *in* forever.
