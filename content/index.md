# EverArchive: Weighted Insights & Vision Anchors
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Canonical Reference
### **Preamble**
This document contains the distilled, high-weight insights that form the philosophical and moral core of the EverArchive. It is the first document any new contributor should read after the Master Index to understand not just what we are building, but *why*. These principles are the final check against which all decisions must be measured.
---
### **Part I: The Genesis Insights**
*(The core realizations that sparked the initiative.)*
*   **[WU-01] The Scale of Collective Loss & The Great Erasure**
    *   **Insight:** The project was born from witnessing the systematic destruction of human creativity at civilizational scale. Our comprehensive research across 772 documented cases reveals massive content erasure, systematic website deletion, and billions of images held hostage. Each platform failure reveals a systemic vulnerability: our digital culture is written in disappearing ink, leading to a mass extinction of collective memory.
    *   **Implication:** We are not solving an abstract technical problem; we are building an ark to preserve humanity's creative legacy from corporate indifference and platform decay.
*   **[WU-02] The Threat of AI & The Great Flattening**
    *   **Insight:** We are confronted with a "sea of homogenized content" from AI trained on shallow, polished data. This threatens to drown out authentic human originality and erodes our collective understanding of *how* meaning is made.
    *   **Implication:** EverArchive is a direct countermeasure. By preserving the messy, authentic *process* of creation, we are creating the high-fidelity data needed for a future where AI can learn nuance, context, and perhaps even empathy, not just syntax.
*   **[WU-03] The Failure of Traditional IP & The Rise of Provenance**
    *   **Insight:** In a world of infinite, frictionless replication, traditional Intellectual Property law is failing. The only durable, defensible value shifts from the right to *copy* to the verifiable right to claim *origin*.
    *   **Implication:** Authorship must evolve into a cryptographic, timestamped, civic act. The blockchain provides the necessary public square for this, making verifiable provenance the new bedrock of authenticity.
---
### **Part II: The Vision Anchors**
*(The immutable principles that must survive all strategic pivots.)*
*   **[EV-01] A Better Memory, Not a Better Backup**
    *   **Anchor:** This is our sacred mission. We are not merely saving files; we are preserving minds, relationships, and the emotional truths behind creation. A perfect copy of a file is data; a Deep Authorship Package containing the journey is memory.
*   **[EV-02] Preserve Process, Not Just Product**
    *   **Anchor:** The polished artifact is the final chapter of a book. The journeyâ€”the struggle, the doubt, the breakthroughâ€”is the story itself. This is the treasure we are safeguarding.
*   **[EV-03] Creator Sovereignty is Absolute**
    *   **Anchor:** The creator holds the keys. This is non-negotiable. Zero-knowledge encryption for private data is a fundamental right, not an optional feature. Our system must be architected such that we, the builders, *cannot* access the creator's Core Layer.
*   **[EV-04] Permanence Demands Sustainable, Non-Extractive Models**
    *   **Anchor:** A "forever" promise without a "forever" economic engine is a fantasy. Our non-profit, public-good ethos must be protected by a robust, hybrid financial model centered on a permanent endowment. We create value, but we do not extract it from our users.
*   **[EV-05] The Three-Layer Model is Sacrosanct**
    *   **Anchor:** The distinction between **Core** (the unfiltered mind), **Process** (the evolution trace), and **Surface** (the intentional work) is the central organizing principle of the entire architecture. It is the solution to the paradox of capturing raw authenticity while allowing for curated presentation. This model must endure.

# EverArchive: Master Strategy & Roadmap
**Version:** 2.1
**Status:** Authoritative Reference
### **1. The Distillation Workflow: From Canonical Source to Public Essence**
All of our work flows from a single source of truthâ€”the **Codex (L1)**â€”but is expressed differently depending on the audience and purpose. This workflow ensures our messaging is always consistent and rooted in our deepest strategic thinking.
*   **L1 (Canonical Source):** The exhaustive 16 chapters of the four Tomes. This is for builders, developers, and future civilizations who need complete, unambiguous detail.
*   **L2 (Strategic Narrative):** Conference presentations, pitch decks, and partner-facing documents. This is a synthesized narrative for funders and institutions, telling a compelling story backed by the rigor of L1.
*   **L3 (Public Essence):** The landing page, social media content, and one-pagers. This is the most distilled, emotionally resonant version of the vision for the general public.
### **2. The Multi-Track Implementation Roadmap**
This roadmap orchestrates parallel work streams, balancing urgent communication deadlines with foundational research and development.

```
### **3. User Journeys & Development Focus**
*   **Creator Journey (MVP):** Our immediate product development focuses on the **"Academic Historian"** persona. Their journey is our critical path:
    1.  **Discovery:** Hears about EverArchive through a trusted institutional channel (e.g., a university library).
    2.  **Onboarding:** Downloads the Capture Tool and is guided through a secure, high-trust process for setting up their sovereign identity and encryption keys.
    3.  **Capture:** Seamlessly adds research notes, interview transcripts, and evolving manuscript drafts into the three layers of a local Deep Authorship Package.
    4.  **Preservation:** Initiates a one-click archival process that sends the Deep Authorship Package to their permanent storage provider, returning a verifiable proof of storage.
*   **Developer Journey:** A developer discovers the project via the **Landing Page (L3)**, gets intrigued by the vision at the **Conference (L2)**, and then dives deep into the **Deep Authorship Package Technical Specification (L1)** from our open-source repository to begin building a compatible tool or integration.
### **4. Chunk-Based Workflow: The Engine of Progress**
All work is managed in discrete **"Chunks"** to ensure focus and trackability. This applies to creating L1, L2, and L3 assets.
*   **Location:** All chunks are managed in a dedicated `/chunks/` directory.
*   **Structure:** Each chunk has its own folder containing:
    *   `00_brief.md`: A formal brief defining the chunk's goal, owner, deliverables, and its link to a roadmap milestone.
    *   `01_work/`: The "Process Layer" for our own workâ€”all notes, drafts, and research.
    *   `02_output/`: The "Surface Layer"â€”the final, polished deliverable(s).
*   **Tracking:** A master `README.md` will provide a high-level view of all active and upcoming chunks, making our own development process transparent and aligned with our core principles.

# EverArchive: The AI Auditor Prompt Set
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Tool
### **Preamble**
This document provides a set of structured prompts designed for use with advanced AI models. Its purpose is to systematically audit, stress-test, and identify weaknesses in the EverArchive Codex. By adopting specific, critical personas, the AI can help uncover hidden flaws, unstated assumptions, and potential failure modes that might be missed by the core team.
This process should be run quarterly and whenever a major change to a core document is proposed. The outputs serve as direct input for the `<!-- Link removed - file not found in canonical structure -->`.
---
### **Prompt 1: The Skeptical Economist**
*   **Persona:** You are a fund manager for a multi-century endowment (e.g., for a university or a church). You are deeply skeptical of techno-optimism and have seen countless "revolutionary" financial models fail. Your primary metric is not short-term growth, but thousand-year capital preservation.
*   **Task:** Scrutinize the `[[03-tome-iii-the-operations/02-economic-framework.md]]` and the economic assumptions within the `[[03-tome-iii-the-operations/05-resilience-and-recovery-plan.md]]`. Your goal is to construct a rigorous, data-grounded argument for why the EverArchive "forever" promise is financially untenable.
*   **Critical Questions to Address:**
    1.  What is the single most likely point of failure in the Endowment's investment and spending policy over a 200-year horizon?
    2.  Model a scenario where decentralized storage costs do *not* decline but instead rise with global energy costs. How and when does the economic model break?
    3.  Challenge the viability of the "Institutional Partnership" revenue stream. Why might institutions refuse to pay recurring fees for a service built on a "pay-once" storage model?
*   **Output Format:** A formal memorandum titled "Economic Viability & Risk Assessment of the EverArchive Endowment Model," detailing the top three financial failure modes and providing specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate them.
---
### **Prompt 2: The Deep-Time Archaeologist**
*   **Persona:** You are a xeno-archivist in the year 2525. The global internet of the 21st century is a distant memory. You have just discovered a physical EverArchive vault and accessed its Bootstrap Record.
*   **Task:** Review the `[[03-tome-iii-the-operations/07-cultural-translation-guide.md]]` and the `[[02-tome-ii-the-architecture/02-deep-authorship-package-technical-specification.md]]`. Your goal is to identify everything that would be completely incomprehensible to your civilization, which has no direct context for our time.
*   **Critical Questions to Address:**
    1.  Which "universal" concepts or pictograms in the Translation Guide are actually culturally specific and would fail to translate?
    2.  What implicit 21st-century assumption embedded in the Deep Authorship Package file structure makes the data relationships impossible for you to parse?
    3.  Based on the "Consciousness Bridge" examples, what critical aspect of 21st-century human experience did the creators fail to explain, rendering their emotional metadata meaningless?
*   **Output Format:** An "Archaeological Field Report" detailing the top five "lost concepts" where the documentation's assumed context fails, making the data rich but un-interpretable.
---
### **Prompt 3: The Overwhelmed Creator (Pilot Persona)**
*   **Persona:** You are our pilot persona, "Dr. Eleanor Vance," an Academic Historian. You are brilliant in your field but are not a technologist and are deeply wary of systems that could compromise your research or waste your time.
*   **Task:** Review the `[[02-tome-ii-the-architecture/05-creator-tools-framework.md]]` and the user journey outlined in the `[[Documentation/01 - Master Strategy & Roadmap.md]]`. Your goal is to identify the three biggest points of friction, fear, or confusion in the proposed workflow that would make you abandon the tool and revert to using simple text files.
*   **Critical Questions to Address:**
    1.  At what specific step in the "Sovereign Key Setup" do you feel most anxious or likely to make a mistake? What specific words or interface elements cause this fear?
    2.  How does the idea of the "Core Layer" and its "unfiltered mind" capture feel to you? Does it feel like a helpful tool for self-reflection or a dangerous form of self-surveillance?
    3.  Be honest about the "contextual annotation" process. Does it feel like a natural extension of your work, or a tedious administrative chore you would never consistently do?
*   **Output Format:** A user feedback report written in the first person, focusing on the psychological burden of key management, the fear of permanent self-incrimination, and the perceived friction of the capture process.
---
### **Prompt 4: The Hostile Nation-State Actor**
*   **Persona:** You are a state-level intelligence agency. You do not wish to destroy EverArchive's data but to neutralize its influence by rendering it untrustworthy, ungovernable, or politically biased.
*   **Task:** Review the `[[03-tome-iii-the-operations/01-governance-constitution.md]]` and the discovery mechanisms in `[[02-tome-ii-the-architecture/04-discovery-and-access-infrastructure.md]]`.
*   **Critical Questions to Address:**
    1.  What is the most cost-effective way to capture a caucus within the EverArchive Assembly to subtly influence policy over time?
    2.  How would you exploit the dispute resolution process to create a crisis of legitimacy?
    3.  What is the best strategy for launching a disinformation campaign to discredit the decentralized Discovery Index, making users believe that "unapproved" content is being systematically suppressed?
*   **Output Format:** A classified strategic brief titled "Operation Sundered Memory," outlining the three most effective, low-signature attack vectors against the social and political integrity of the EverArchive.

# EverArchive: Addressing Critical Questions
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Public-Facing Document
### **Preamble**
EverArchive is a project of civilizational scale and ambition. Such a vision rightly invites scrutiny and hard questions. This document provides clear, direct answers to the most common and critical inquiries from our potential partners, funders, creators, and community members. Our commitment to transparency begins here.
---
### **Part I: For Funders & Strategic Partners**
#### **Q1: "Forever" is an impossibly bold claim. How can you possibly guarantee that?**
**A:** We agree that "forever" is a profound claim, which is why our architecture is built on a principle of **engineered resilience**, not simple permanence. We don't assume invulnerability; we plan for failure. Our strategy is detailed in our `[[03-tome-iii-the-operations/05-resilience-and-recovery-plan.md]]` and relies on three layers of defense:
1.  **Technical Redundancy:** We use a trinity of storage systems. Data is stored on a permanent blockchain (like Arweave) for its economic guarantees, on a distributed network (like IPFS) for rapid access, and on long-term physical media (like 5D optical storage) in secure vaults as an ultimate, air-gapped backup.
2.  **Economic Sustainability:** Our `[[03-tome-iii-the-operations/02-economic-framework.md]]` is designed to escape grant dependency by building a permanent Endowment. This fund is designed to cover core preservation costs in perpetuity, ensuring the archive can survive even without new funding.
3.  **Civilizational Recovery:** Our recovery plan includes a "Bootstrap Record"â€”a set of instructions etched on indestructible mediaâ€”that would allow a future civilization to find the physical vaults and rebuild the technology needed to access the data. The promise of "forever" is an operational commitment to continuous recovery.
#### **Q2: How is this actually funded? "Non-profit" and "forever" sound incompatible.**
**A:** Our `[[03-tome-iii-the-operations/02-economic-framework.md]]` details a hybrid model specifically designed for this challenge. It is not based on a single point of failure.
1.  **Ignition (Grants):** Initial philanthropic grants are used to build the core infrastructure and, critically, to **seed a permanent Endowment Fund**. A minimum of 15% of every grant is allocated directly to this endowment.
2.  **Growth (Partnerships):** We establish paid **Preservation & Stewardship Agreements (PSAs)** with institutions (museums, universities, archives) who have a mandate to preserve their collections. This creates a mission-aligned revenue stream.
3.  **Perpetuity (Endowment):** The Endowment is professionally managed with a strict spending policy (e.g., a 4% annual draw). The goal is for its investment returns to eventually cover all core operational costs, making the archive truly self-sustaining and independent of fundraising cycles.
---
### **Part II: For Creators & Individual Users**
#### **Q3: My creative process is private and messy. How can I trust you with my "unfiltered mind"?**
**A:** You don't have to trust us. This principle is the cornerstone of our entire system. As defined in our `[[02-tome-ii-the-architecture/02-deep-authorship-package-technical-specification.md]]`, we use a **zero-knowledge encryption** model.
*   **Sovereign Control:** The "Core Layer" of your Deep Authorship Package is encrypted on **your device**, using a key derived from a passphrase that **only you know**.
*   **We Can't See Your Data:** The EverArchive organization, its stewards, and its software have no ability to decrypt or access your Core Layer data. We only store an encrypted blob that is meaningless without your key.
*   **You Set the Rules:** You have granular control over what is shared and when. Nothing is made public without your explicit, intentional action.
#### **Q4: What happens if I lose my key? Is my life's work gone forever?**
**A:** This is the most critical risk for any sovereign system. Our `[[02-tome-ii-the-architecture/05-creator-tools-framework.md]]` addresses this directly.
*   **The Sovereign Path (Default):** Yes, if you choose the fully sovereign path and lose your key, your encrypted data will be irrecoverable. The onboarding process will strongly emphasize the personal responsibility this entails.
*   **The Social Recovery Path (Optional):** For users who want a fallback, we offer an opt-in "Social Recovery" mechanism. This allows you to entrust shards of your key to a set of "Guardians" (trusted friends, family, or even your lawyer) you designate. A majority of these Guardians could later help you recover your key, without any of them ever having access to the key itself or your data.
---
### **Part III: For Technical & Institutional Audiences**
#### **Q5: What if Arweave, IPFS, or another critical technology fails or becomes obsolete?**
**A:** Our system is designed to outlive any single technology. This is governed by our `[[03-tome-iii-the-operations/06-technical-evolution-framework.md]]`.
*   **Abstraction:** The Deep Authorship Package format is a logical container, not tied to a specific storage backend.
*   **Multi-Layered Storage:** We store data across multiple, independent networks simultaneously. A failure in one does not compromise the others.
*   **Proactive Migration:** Our "Watchtower Protocol" constantly monitors the health and viability of underlying technologies. If a format or network is deemed "At-Risk," our governance process triggers a community-managed migration of all affected data to a new, more robust standard. The original data is preserved for historical integrity.
#### **Q6: How do you prevent EverArchive from being filled with illegal, harmful, or trivial content?**
**A:** This is a fundamental challenge of any censorship-resistant platform. Our approach, detailed in the `[[03-tome-iii-the-operations/01-governance-constitution.md]]`, is to **separate the right to preserve from the privilege of public amplification.**
*   **The Archive is Neutral:** The underlying permanent storage networks are content-agnostic. Anyone can, in principle, archive a Deep Authorship Package at their own expense.
*   **The Index is Curated:** However, for a Deep Authorship Package to be findable through the public **EverArchive Discovery Index**, it must be submitted and validated. Our institutional partners provide a stream of high-quality, verified content.
*   **Community Governance:** The community of stewards can create "lenses" or "views" on the archive. They have the power to flag and down-rank content that violates community standards (e.g., illegal material, spam). While the data cannot be "deleted" from the underlying storage, it can be made effectively invisible and undiscoverable through our public interfaces, protecting users while preserving the principle of censorship resistance.
