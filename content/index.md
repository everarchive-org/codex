## About This Codex

The EverArchive Codex represents the complete knowledge base for building civilizational memory infrastructure. It is organized to support multiple audiences:

- **Visionaries**: Start with Tome I to understand the philosophy and mission
- **Builders**: Focus on Tome II for technical specifications and architecture
