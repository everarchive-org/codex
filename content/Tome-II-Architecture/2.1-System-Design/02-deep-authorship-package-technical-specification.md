### **1. Introduction & Scope**

#### **1.1. Purpose**

This document provides the complete technical specification for the **Deep Authorship Package**, version 2.0. The Deep Authorship Package is a canonical, time-interpretable, and sovereign data container designed to preserve the complete cognitive and emotional lineage of a creative work. While it is the preferred format for the EverArchive ecosystem, the system also supports ingestion and preservation of content in established archival formats (METS, MODS, Dublin Core, PREMIS) through the Schema Projector interoperability framework. Adherence to this specification is mandatory for all tools that create, read, or modify native Deep Authorship Packages to ensure universal interoperability and long-term preservation.

#### **1.2. Core Design Principles**

*   **Self-Contained:** A Deep Authorship Package must contain all information necessary for its own interpretation.
*   **Layered:** The structure must reflect the Three-Layer Memory Model (Core, Process, Surface).
*   **Sovereign & Local-First:** The object is designed to be created and managed on a creator's local device, with user-controlled, zero-knowledge encryption for its most sensitive layer.
*   **Interoperable:** Based on open standards (JSON-LD, etc.) to facilitate seamless integration with existing archival formats and workflows. The Schema Projector enables bidirectional translation between Deep Authorship Packages and established standards like METS, MODS, Dublin Core, and PREMIS, allowing institutions to work with familiar formats while preserving the unique features of Deep Authorship when possible.
*   **Permanent:** Designed for immutable, content-addressed storage networks.

### **2. Container Format & Structure**

#### **2.1. Physical Format**

A Deep Authorship Package is a compressed archive conforming to the **ZIP (.zip)** specification. The use of ZIP ensures broad, cross-platform compatibility and accessibility using standard libraries.
*   **Compression Algorithm:** All files within the archive (except for already compressed media formats) SHOULD be compressed using **Zstandard (ZSTD)** for its balance of high compression ratio and fast decompression speed.

#### **2.2. Canonical Directory Structure**

Every valid Deep Authorship Package MUST adhere to the following directory structure at its root:

```
my-creative-work/
├── manifest.json
├── metadata/
│   ├── authorship.json
│   ├── permissions.json
│   └── context.jsonld
├── core/
│   └── [encrypted blobs]
├── process/
│   └── [version diffs, annotations, etc.]
└── surface/
    └── [final work files]
```

---

### **3. The `manifest.json` Specification**

The `manifest.json` file is the entry point and integrity record for the entire object. It MUST be located at the root of the archive.

### **6. The `core/` Directory & Encryption Protocol**

This directory holds the raw, unfiltered, and most sensitive data from the creator's process.

#### **6.1. Encryption is Mandatory**

All files within the `core/` directory MUST be encrypted. Plaintext storage in this directory is a violation of the specification.

#### **6.2. The EverArchive Encryption Standard (EES-1.0)**

1.  **Key Derivation:** A high-entropy passphrase, known only to the creator, is used as input to the **Argon2id** key derivation function to generate a 256-bit symmetric encryption key (`symKey`). This process MUST be performed client-side.
2.  **Content Encryption:** Each file in the `core/` directory is encrypted using **AES-256-GCM**. This provides both confidentiality and authenticity. A unique nonce must be used for each encryption operation.
3.  **Post-Quantum Key Protection (Key Encapsulation):** To protect against future attacks by quantum computers, the `symKey` is itself protected.
    a. A public/private key pair is generated using the **CRYSTALS-Kyber** algorithm (a NIST PQC standard).
    b. The `symKey` is encapsulated using the Kyber public key, resulting in a ciphertext (`encapsulatedKey`).
    c. The Kyber private key is encrypted with the `symKey` (or another derived key) and can be sharded for social recovery using Shamir's Secret Sharing.
4.  **Storage:** The encrypted file content, the GCM authentication tag, the nonce, and the `encapsulatedKey` are stored. To decrypt, a user must provide their passphrase to derive `symKey`, use `symKey` to decrypt the Kyber private key, and then use the Kyber private/public key pair to decapsulate `encapsulatedKey` and retrieve the original `symKey` for decrypting the content.

### **8. Versioning & Extensibility**

*   **Versioning of a Deep Authorship Package:** A new version of a work is created by generating a *new* Deep Authorship Package and setting its `parentDap` field to the `dapId` of the previous version. This creates an immutable, backward-linked chain of provenance.
*   **Extensibility:** Custom metadata fields can be added to any JSON file, ideally within a custom namespace (e.g., `"my-app:customField": "value"`) to avoid conflicts. All extensions should be documented using JSON Schema.
*   **Format Interoperability:** While Deep Authorship Package (DAP) is the native format, EverArchive supports preservation of content in multiple formats. The Schema Projector (detailed in Doc 2.3) enables:
    * Import from standard archival formats (METS, MODS, Dublin Core, PREMIS)
    * Export to standard formats with documented data loss analysis
    * Hybrid preservation strategies maintaining both native Deep Authorship Package and institutional formats
    * Progressive enhancement where content starts in standard formats and gains Deep Authorship features over time

### **9. Conclusion**

The DAP v2.0 specification provides a robust, secure, and philosophically-aligned framework for the preservation of deep creative memory. It balances the need for rich, complex data capture with the non-negotiable requirements of creator sovereignty and long-term durability. Its successful implementation is the cornerstone of the EverArchive's mission.
