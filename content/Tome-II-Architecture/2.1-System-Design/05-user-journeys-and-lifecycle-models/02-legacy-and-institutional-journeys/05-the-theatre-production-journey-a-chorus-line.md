### **Part 1: The Ingestion Experience - From World to Archive**

#### **The Curation Narrative: Preserving the Line**
*A Chorus Line* was revolutionary because it wasn't written; it was *assembled*. Director-choreographer Michael Bennett held marathon, taped workshop sessions where dozens of Broadway dancers ("gypsies") shared their deepest, most personal stories of ambition, struggle, and sacrifice. These candid, real-life monologues were then edited, shaped, and transformed into the script of the final musical. The goal of this journey is to digitally reunite the polished, iconic final show with the raw, authentic human stories that gave it its heart, preserving one of the most important creative processes in theatre history.

**The Ingestion Process: The Great Reassembly**
The NYPL curators lead the effort to build the object.

1.  **The Object for "A Chorus Line (1975)":**
    *   **Surface Layer (The Final Product):** The official, final script (libretto) of the musical. The cast album audio files (FLAC). High-resolution production photos from the original Broadway run. The iconic poster art.
    *   **Process Layer (The Verifiable Journey):** This layer documents the show's transformation from therapy session to blockbuster.
        *   **The Workshop Tapes:** The complete, digitized audio of the 24 hours of workshop sessions with the dancers.
        *   **Transcripts:** Full, searchable transcripts of the workshop tapes.
        *   **Choreography:** Michael Bennett's personal notebooks, containing his unique, idiosyncratic dance notation for the show's iconic numbers.
        *   **Design:** Scans of Theoni V. Aldredge's original costume sketches and Robin Wagner's set design blueprints.
    *   **Core Layer (The Deep Context):** This layer holds the most personal and foundational materials.
        *   **The Dancers' Stories:** For each major character in the show (Cassie, Diana, Paul, etc.), this layer contains the full, unedited segment of the workshop tape featuring the real-life dancer (e.g., Donna McKechnie, Priscilla Lopez, Sammy Williams) telling the story that would become their character's monologue.
        *   **Bennett's Notes:** Michael Bennett's private directorial and conceptual notes, outlining his vision and his struggles to shape the material.
        *   **Casting Records:** The original casting call notices and headshots of the dancers who participated.

**The Interlinking (The Semantic Weave):**
This is where the magic of reuniting process and product happens.
*   The character Diana's song, "Nothing," in the final libretto (**Surface**) is linked directly to the 15-minute section of the workshop tape in the **Core Layer** where the real Priscilla Lopez tells the story of her terrible acting class.
*   A specific dance step in the "I Hope I Get It" opening number, seen in a production photo (**Surface**), is linked to Bennett's corresponding diagram in his notebook (**Process**).
*   A line in a critic's review praising the show's authenticity (**Process**) is linked to the raw, emotional source monologues (**Core**).

### **Part 2: The Publishing Experience - The Living Document**

#### **The Publishing Workflow & The Schema Projector**
*   **The Steward's Action:** The NYPL uses the EverArchive object to create a new online educational exhibit.
*   **The Schema Projector in Action:**
    *   **The Annotated Libretto View:** The default projector shows the final script. However, key lines and song titles are interactive. Clicking on "The Music and the Mirror" brings up a window with Bennett's choreographic notes and a short video clip of Donna McKechnie rehearsing it.
    *   **The Director's View:** A theatre student can select this projector. It renders the script in a "prompt-book" format, showing the text on one side and the original blocking and lighting cues on the other, pulled from the Process Layer.
*   **The Value Proposition:** This creates the ultimate study guide. It allows students and professionals to understand the show not as a static text, but as a complex, multi-layered performance piece, with direct access to the source material that inspired every moment.

### **Part 3: The Archival Act - Defining a Permanent Legacy**

**The Archival Workflow:**
The `v1.0` object is declared complete, representing the definitive record of this landmark production.

**The Permissions & Consent Configuration:**
*   **Sovereign Permissions:** The Surface Layer is public. The Process Layer (dance notation, design sketches) is available to theatre professionals and researchers. The Core Layer (the raw dancer monologues) is restricted, requiring credentials to access, respecting the personal nature of the stories.
*   **AI Training Consent:** Set to **YES** for non-commercial analysis of theatrical structure and narrative development, but **NO** to using the dancers' personal stories to train generative character AIs.

### **Part 4: The Consumption Experience - A Multi-Faceted Afterlife**

#### **Consumption Scenario A: The Human Connection (The Young Actor)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** A young actor preparing to audition for the role of "Paul."
*   **The Discovery & Access:** He gains access to the restricted Core Layer through his university's theatre department license.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** He reads Paul's heartbreaking monologue about his childhood experiences in the script (Surface). But then, he listens to the actual, unedited workshop tape in the **Core Layer**. He hears the real Sammy Williams, voice cracking, telling his own life story to Michael Bennett for the first time. He hears the pauses, the hesitations, the raw, unscripted emotion.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The actor gains a level of psychological and emotional insight into his character that is profound and transformative. He is not just reciting lines; he is channeling a real person's lived experience. His audition is not a performance; it is a testimony.

#### **Consumption Scenario B: The AI / Agentic Web Connection (The Dramaturgical AI)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** An AI assistant for a director staging a new production of the show in 2070.
*   **The Task & Access:** The director asks the AI, "What was the original conceptual purpose of the mirrors in the set design?"
*   **The Synthesis & Insight:** The AI ingests the full object.
    1.  It analyzes the set blueprints in the **Process Layer**.
    2.  It cross-references them with Michael Bennett's directorial notes in the **Core Layer**, where he talks about forcing the dancers to confront themselves.
    3.  It then analyzes the transcripts of the workshop tapes and finds that the theme of "self-reflection" appears 73% more often than any other theme.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The AI provides a deeply insightful answer: "The mirrors were not just a design choice; they were the physical manifestation of the show's core theme, which emerged directly from the dancers' own introspective stories. They force the audience, like the characters, to confront their own ambitions and identities." The AI acts as a perfect dramaturg, using the preserved process to reveal the deepest layers of artistic intent.
