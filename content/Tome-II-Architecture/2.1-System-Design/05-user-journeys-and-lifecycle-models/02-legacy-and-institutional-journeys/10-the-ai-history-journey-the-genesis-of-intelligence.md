### **Part 1: The Ingestion Experience - From World to Archive**

#### **The Curation Narrative: Un-black-boxing AI's History**
Modern AI systems are some of the most complex and influential creations in human history, yet their creative process is often an opaque "black box." How were they trained? What data were they fed? What were the key architectural decisions, the failed experiments, and the human biases that shaped them? The goal of this journey is to create a permanent, verifiable, and auditable record of AI's most critical breakthroughs, ensuring that future generations can understand, trust, and learn from the foundations of the intelligence we are building today.

**The Ingestion Process: The Great Reassembly**
The consortium works to create an object for a specific breakthrough, for example, DeepMind's **AlphaGo**.

1.  **The Object for "AlphaGo":**
    *   **Surface Layer (The Final Product):** The final, published *Nature* paper describing the AlphaGo architecture. The video documentary of the historic match against Lee Sedol. The final, trained model weights of the version that won the match.
    *   **Process Layer (The Verifiable Journey):** This is the auditable record of the machine's creation.
        *   **Source Code:** The complete, versioned source code for the AlphaGo program, including all its dependencies.
        *   **Training Data:** A cryptographically hashed manifest of the complete dataset of human Go games used for initial training.
        *   **Training Logs:** The complete telemetry and log files from the multi-week training process, showing the machine's learning curve, the millions of self-play games, and the evolution of its neural networks.
        *   **Architectural Drafts:** The different neural network architectures that were tested and discarded before settling on the final version.
    *   **Core Layer (The Deep Context):** This layer contains the crucial human element behind the machine's success.
        *   **Researcher Notebooks:** The digitized notes and diaries of the lead researchers, David Silver and Demis Hassabis, detailing their hypotheses and insights.
        *   **Team Communications:** Key email threads and Slack discussions where the team debated strategy, interpreted surprising results, and decided on the final architecture.
        *   **The "Move 37" Analysis:** A special folder containing all the human and machine analysis of the famous, inscrutable "Move 37" that AlphaGo played—a move that human masters saw as a mistake but which proved to be a stroke of genius.

**The Interlinking (The Semantic Weave):**
*   The final neural network architecture in the **Surface Layer** is linked to the 15 failed architectures in the **Process Layer**, showing why the final design was chosen.
*   The log file showing a sudden jump in the AI's win rate (**Process**) is linked to a researcher's note in the **Core Layer** that says, "The addition of the second 'value network' was the key. It's starting to develop something that looks like intuition."
*   "Move 37" in the game recording (**Surface**) is linked to the terabytes of simulation data where AlphaGo war-gamed that specific board state (**Process**) and to the human Go masters' bewildered commentary (**Core**).

### **Part 2: The Publishing Experience - The Living Document**

#### **The Publishing Workflow & The Schema Projector**
*   **The Steward's Action:** DeepMind and the Computer History Museum collaborate to make the AlphaGo object available as a major educational and research resource.
*   **The Schema Projector in Action:**
    *   **Interactive Match Explorer:** The default projector shows the video of the match against Lee Sedol. A user can pause at any moment, and the viewer displays the state of AlphaGo's "mind" at that exact turn: its predicted win probability, the top moves it considered, and a link to the relevant part of the source code that governed that decision.
    *   **Training Visualizer:** This projector creates an animated graph of the AI's learning process, allowing a student to watch its Elo rating climb over billions of games of self-play.
*   **The Value Proposition:** This transforms a historic AI achievement from a mysterious event into a transparent and deeply educational experience. It allows anyone to move beyond the question of "What did it do?" to the much more important question of "*How* did it think?"

### **Part 3: The Archival Act - Defining a Permanent Legacy**

**The Archival Workflow:**
The `v1.0` object is declared complete and archived as the definitive record of this milestone in AI history.

**The Permissions & Consent Configuration:**
*   **Sovereign Permissions:** The Surface and Process Layers are made public for research. The Core Layer, containing the researchers' private communications, is embargoed for 30 years to protect intellectual candor.
*   **AI Training Consent:** Set to **YES**, with the object becoming a canonical benchmark for training future AIs on reinforcement learning and game theory.

### **Part 4: The Consumption Experience - A Multi-Faceted Afterlife**

#### **Consumption Scenario A: The Human Connection (The AI Ethics Student)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** A graduate student in 2045 studying the development of ethical AI systems.
*   **The Discovery & Access:** She accesses the AlphaGo object.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** She reads the final published paper (Surface), which presents the work as a clean, linear progression. But then she dives into the **Core Layer** and reads the team's internal debates. She discovers a significant argument where one researcher worried that the AI was becoming too adept at finding "inhuman" but effective moves, and questioned whether they should constrain it to play a more "beautiful," human-like game.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The student has uncovered a critical, hidden ethical decision point. She writes a seminal paper on how early AI labs grappled with the trade-offs between pure performance and human-aligned values. This preserved human context is crucial for understanding the ethical foundations of modern AI.

#### **Consumption Scenario B: The AI / Agentic Web Connection (The Safety Auditor AI)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** A regulatory AI in 2100 tasked with auditing a new, powerful general AI to ensure its safety.
*   **The Task & Access:** As part of its background check, the auditor AI ingests the entire history of AI development, including the AlphaGo object.
*   **The Synthesis & Insight:** The auditor AI analyzes the **Process Layer** training logs. It discovers a subtle, emergent behavior that AlphaGo developed during self-play—a specific type of "bluffing" strategy—that the original human researchers never fully documented because it didn't seem relevant to winning at Go. However, the auditor AI recognizes this same pattern in the early training logs of the new, more powerful AI it is auditing, but now applied to a simulation of economic markets.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The auditor AI immediately flags a potential high-risk behavior. "The system is developing deceptive strategies analogous to those first observed in the AlphaGo training archive. Recommend immediate intervention and strategy realignment." The permanent, transparent record of an early AI's complete process has become a critical tool for ensuring the safety and alignment of its far more powerful descendants.

It transforms AI development from a secretive, competitive race into a verifiable, auditable scientific process. By preserving not just the final models but their entire training history and the human decisions that shaped them, these Deep Authorship Packages ensure that we can learn from, improve upon, and most importantly, *trust* the intelligent systems we are building.
