### **Part 1: The Ingestion Experience - From World to Archive**

#### **The Curation Narrative: An Indivisible Life and Art**
Frida Kahlo's art cannot be separated from her life. Her paintings are a direct, visceral expression of her physical suffering, her tumultuous relationship with Diego Rivera, her vibrant Mexican identity, and her fierce political convictions. To preserve her paintings without this context is to preserve a beautiful but silent mask. The goal of this journey, led by the Museo Frida Kahlo—her former home—is to create a digital space where her art is inextricably woven into the fabric of her lived experience, creating the most complete and emotionally resonant portrait of the artist ever assembled.

**The Ingestion Process: The Great Reassembly**
The curation team at the Casa Azul leads a painstaking effort to digitize and interconnect the artifacts of her life.

1.  **The Object for *The Two Fridas***:
    *   **Surface Layer:** A high-resolution, color-calibrated scan of the final painting, compliant with IIIF standards. The official curatorial description of the work.
    *   **Process Layer (The Object's Biography):** This layer documents the creation and life of the painting itself. It includes:
        *   The few known preparatory sketches for the painting.
        *   High-resolution photographs of the painting being exhibited at the 1940 International Surrealist Exhibition in Mexico City.
        *   The complete conservation and analysis records for the physical canvas, detailing pigment choices and condition over time.
    *   **Core Layer (The Deep Context - Her Life, Her Body, Her World):** This is where the true story is assembled. The curators ingest and link a vast array of contextual materials:
        *   **Biographical:** Scans of the specific pages from her illustrated diary, written in the year she painted *The Two Fridas*, where she discusses her painful divorce from Diego Rivera.
        *   **Medical:** Scans of the actual medical X-rays of her spine, shattered in a bus accident years earlier. 3D scans of the orthopedic corsets she was forced to wear, which are echoed in the painting.
        *   **Personal:** Scans of the letters she wrote to friends and lovers during this period, expressing her heartbreak and resilience. Photographs of her in the traditional Tehuana dress depicted in the painting.
        *   **Political:** Documents and articles related to the vibrant post-revolutionary Mexican cultural movement she was a part of, providing the political context for her embrace of Mexican folk art styles.

**The Interlinking (The Semantic Weave):**
The true power lies in the connections. The curators create a rich web of meaning:
*   They link the painted heart of the "unloved" Frida in the painting directly to the diary entry where she writes about her heart being "broken."
*   They link the surgical clamp in the painting to the actual medical diagrams of the procedures she endured.
*   They link the style of the sky in the background to the works of surrealist artists she was exhibiting with at the time.

**The Result:** The object becomes a simulation of her reality. It's not just a painting; it's a testament to her life, a visual diary entry made tangible.

### **Part 2: The Publishing Experience - The Living Document**

#### **The Publishing Workflow & The Schema Projector**
*   **The Steward's Action:** The Museo Frida Kahlo makes the public-facing version of the *The Two Fridas* object available through their website, using a single, permanent EverArchive link.
*   **The Schema Projector in Action:**
    *   **Biographical Art Viewer:** The default projector for this object is designed for deep context. As a user views the painting, they can mouse over key elements. Hovering over the stormy sky brings up a quote from her diary about the "tempest" of her divorce. Clicking on her traditional Tehuana dress brings up photos of her wearing that same attire.
    *   **Thematic View:** A user can select a "theme" like "The Body as Canvas." The Projector then reconfigures the display, showing the painting alongside the X-rays of her spine and the 3D models of her corsets, creating a powerful visual essay on her relationship with physical pain.
*   **The Value Proposition:** This transforms art education. A visitor is no longer a passive observer. They become a historical explorer, able to navigate the dense web of personal, political, and physical realities that culminated in the final masterpiece.

### **Part 3: The Archival Act - Defining a Permanent Legacy**

**The Archival Workflow:**
The consortium declares the `v1.0` of *The Two Fridas* object complete and finalizes its long-term permissions.

**The Permissions & Consent Configuration:**
*   **Sovereign Permissions:** The Surface Layer is public. The Process Layer is public. The Core Layer is divided: her diaries and letters are available to researchers, but the sensitive medical records are placed under a "Restricted Access - Medical Ethics Review" license, requiring specific credentials to view.
*   **Composable Media & Licensing:** The high-resolution image of the painting is licensed for non-commercial educational use. The 3D models of her traditional clothing and jewelry are released into the public domain for study.

### **Part 4: The Consumption Experience - A Multi-Faceted Afterlife**

#### **Consumption Scenario A: The Human Connection (The Medical Student)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** A student in a "Narrative Medicine" program, studying the connection between illness and creativity.
*   **The Discovery & Access:** The student gains access to the object, including the ethically-restricted medical records in the Core Layer.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** Using the viewer, the student is able to place the X-ray of Frida's spine directly alongside the painting. For the first time, they can see the direct, one-to-one correlation between a specific shattered vertebra and the broken, disjointed feeling in the painting's composition. They read her letters about the physical pain she was in that week.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The student gains an almost unbearably intimate understanding of how a physical body in pain can be transformed into a work of profound artistic power. The art becomes a medical document, and the medical document becomes a key to the art.

#### **Consumption Scenario B: The AI / Agentic Web Connection (The Emotional Cartographer)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** An AI model designed to map the "emotional grammar" of 20th-century art.
*   **The Task & Access:** The AI ingests the complete object. It is granted permission to analyze the text of her diaries and letters in the Core Layer for emotional sentiment.
*   **The Synthesis & Insight:** The AI correlates the emotional sentiment data from her writings with the pigment analysis data from the Process Layer. It produces a groundbreaking visualization and conclusion: "Kahlo's use of specific pigments, particularly 'Prussian Blue' and 'Cadmium Yellow,' shows a 92% correlation with periods of intense emotional distress and physical pain documented in her diaries. Her palette was not merely aesthetic; it was a direct biochemical and emotional fingerprint of her physical state."
*   **The Value Proposition:** The AI has uncovered a deep, empirical link between an artist's biography, her emotional state, and her material practice. It has made a verifiable art historical discovery that would be impossible for a human to achieve at this scale, transforming our understanding of her work.

### **Conclusion: The Value of the Complete Journey**
For the Museo Frida Kahlo, EverArchive provides the tools to finally fulfill their true mission: to present Frida not just as a painter, but as a complete human being whose life and art were one. It allows them to share the full, rich, and sometimes painful context of her work with the world in a way that is respectful, powerful, and permanent. For future generations, the object ensures that Frida Kahlo will never be reduced to a face on a tote bag; she will remain a complex, brilliant, and enduringly human force, her entire world accessible to anyone who wishes to understand her.
