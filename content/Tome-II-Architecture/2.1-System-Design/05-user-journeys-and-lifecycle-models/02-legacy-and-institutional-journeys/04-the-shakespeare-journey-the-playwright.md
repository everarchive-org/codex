### **Part 1: The Ingestion Experience - From World to Archive**

#### **The Curation Narrative: Reconstructing a Lost World**
William Shakespeare's final manuscripts are lost to time. We have no handwritten drafts, no notebooks, no letters explaining his intent. His "process" is an archaeological mystery, hinted at only by the variations in the early printed editions of his plays. The goal of this journey is not to recover what is lost, but to reassemble the entire world that shaped *Hamlet* and to make the surviving textual variations explorable. It's an act of maximalist curation: creating the richest, most deeply contextualized edition of a single play ever attempted.

**The Ingestion Process: The Great Reassembly**
The consortium pools its resources and expertise to build the *Hamlet* object.

1.  **The Object for "Hamlet":**
    *   **Surface Layer (The Canonical Texts):** High-resolution, fully transcribed scans of the three crucial early editions of *Hamlet*:
        *   The "Bad" First Quarto (1603)
        *   The "Good" Second Quarto (1604)
        *   The First Folio (1623)
        Each text is encoded using the TEI standard.
    *   **Process Layer (The Textual & Historical Journey):** This is where the world is rebuilt.
        *   **Source Texts:** Digitized versions of the historical sources Shakespeare drew upon, like the Scandinavian legend of Amleth by Saxo Grammaticus and Thomas Kyd's earlier play, *The Spanish Tragedy*.
        *   **Linguistic Context:** A comprehensive glossary and analysis of Elizabethan English, explaining words and phrases that have changed meaning.
        *   **Performance History:** Scans of prompt-books, playbills, and reviews from famous productions of *Hamlet* over the last 400 years. 3D models of the Globe Theatre reconstruction in London.
    *   **Core Layer (The Deep Context):** This layer contains the scholarly and cultural DNA surrounding the play.
        *   **Scholarly Corpus:** A library of the most influential academic essays and books written about *Hamlet*.
        *   **Historical Context:** Documents on Elizabethan court politics, succession anxiety under Queen Elizabeth I, popular beliefs about ghosts, and the philosophy of Renaissance humanism.
        *   **Biographical Context:** Records related to Shakespeare's own life at the time, including the death of his son, Hamnet, a few years prior to writing the play.

**The Interlinking (The Semantic Weave):**
This is a massive scholarly endeavor.
*   Every single line of the three primary texts (Q1, Q2, F1) is linked, allowing a reader to instantly compare the variations.
*   The line "Frailty, thy name is woman!" is linked to a collection of common proverbs and religious sermons about women from the period, providing deep cultural context.
*   The appearance of the ghost is linked to contemporary pamphlets on spiritualism and the Protestant vs. Catholic views on Purgatory.
*   The "To be or not to be" soliloquy is linked to its divergent version in the First Quarto and to dozens of scholarly essays analyzing its meaning.

### **Part 2: The Publishing Experience - The Living Document**

#### **The Publishing Workflow & The Schema Projector**
*   **The Steward's Action:** The Folger Shakespeare Library, as a lead steward, makes the *Hamlet* object public via a dedicated educational portal.
*   **The Schema Projector in Action:** A user can choose their desired "lens" for the material.
    *   **Reader's View:** The default projector shows a clean, modern-spelling version of the First Folio text, with simple pop-up annotations for obscure words.
    *   **Scholar's View:** This projector displays the Q2 and F1 texts side-by-side, with differences highlighted. Clicking a word reveals its etymology and links to every other time Shakespeare used it.
    *   **Actor's View:** This projector formats the text with wide margins for notes and provides audio recordings of famous actors (like Laurence Olivier and David Tennant) performing key speeches, linked from the Process Layer.
*   **The "Living Update" Experience:** A new academic paper is published that uses computational analysis to argue convincingly that a specific passage was co-written with another playwright. A curator reviews the paper, adds it to the **Core Layer**, and links its argument to the relevant lines in the text. The scholarly view is **instantly updated** with this new interpretation. The object is a living, breathing edition of the play that never goes out of date.
*   **The Value Proposition:** This moves beyond a static "Complete Works." It creates a dynamic platform for Shakespearean scholarship and education, a single, universally accessible resource that is always growing richer and more complete.

### **Part 3: The Archival Act - Defining a Permanent Legacy**

**The Archival Workflow:**
The consortium declares the `v1.0` object, representing the pinnacle of current Shakespearean scholarship, as the new standard edition for the 21st century.

**The Permissions & Consent Configuration:**
*   **Sovereign Permissions:** The entire object is made public, as the underlying works are long in the public domain.
*   **Composable Media & Licensing:** All primary texts, transcriptions, and 3D models are released under a `CC0` (Public Domain) dedication to encourage maximum educational reuse.

### **Part 4: The Consumption Experience - A Multi-Faceted Afterlife**

#### **Consumption Scenario A: The Human Connection (The High School Student)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** A 16-year-old student, "Chloe," struggling to read *Hamlet* for the first time.
*   **The Discovery & Access:** Her teacher directs her to the public EverArchive *Hamlet* object.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** She finds the text difficult. She toggles on the "Plain English" Schema Projector, which provides a modern paraphrase next to the original. Still confused about the ghost, she clicks on the line "I am thy father's spirit." A sidebar opens with content from the **Core Layer**, explaining the conflicting religious views on ghosts in Shakespeare's time. Suddenly, she understands Hamlet's dilemma: is this a noble spirit from Purgatory or a demon sent to trick him? The central conflict of the play clicks into place.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The object has transformed a difficult, intimidating text into an accessible and exciting world of discovery. It doesn't just give her the play; it gives her the entire world needed to understand it.

#### **Consumption Scenario B: The AI / Agentic Web Connection (The Virtual Reality Director)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** An AI in 2085 tasked with creating a fully immersive, historically accurate VR production of *Hamlet*.
*   **The Task & Access:** The AI ingests the entire object.
*   **The Synthesis & Insight:**
    1.  It uses the 3D models of the Globe Theatre from the **Process Layer** to construct the virtual stage.
    2.  It uses the costume designs and historical documents from the **Core Layer** to clothe the virtual actors accurately.
    3.  It analyzes the linguistic data to instruct the AI actors on the precise pronunciation of Elizabethan English.
    4.  Most importantly, it analyzes the scholarly essays and the different Quarto/Folio versions to inform the AI actors' performances. For "To be or not to be," it instructs the lead actor to deliver the lines with a mix of philosophical contemplation (from the Folio text) and raw, immediate grief (a reading suggested by the context of Hamnet's death).
*   **The Value Proposition:** The AI can create the most historically informed and textually nuanced production of *Hamlet* in history, because it has access to the complete, interconnected web of scholarly, historical, and textual knowledge. The Deep Authorship Package becomes the foundational "ground truth" for all future interpretations.

### **Conclusion: The Value of the Complete Journey**
For the world's leading libraries, EverArchive provides a platform to transform their most prized literary treasures from static, printed artifacts into living, dynamic, and interconnected digital ecosystems. For students, actors, and scholars, the *Hamlet* object is the ultimate tool for understanding, a portal into the world that created the play. It proves that even for a legacy where the creator's own process is lost, the Deep Authorship model can be used to reassemble its world, preserving not just the text, but the universe of meaning that surrounds it.
