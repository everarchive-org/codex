### **Part 1: The Ingestion Experience - Weaving a Global Mind in Full Context**

#### **The Curation Narrative: Reassembling a World, Not Just a Man**
For 500 years, Leonardo da Vinci's mind has been scattered across the globe. The art historian studies his paintings in Paris, the medical historian studies his anatomical drawings in London, and the engineer studies his codices on flight in Milan. They are all studying the same mind, but through disconnected fragments. "The Leonardo Project" is a groundbreaking consortium formed to digitally reunify this legacy. Their goal is not to create a single, centralized database, but a decentralized network of interconnected Deep Authorship Packages, each stewarded by its custodial institution but linked together to form a holistic, explorable map of da Vinci's thought and the world he inhabited.

**The Ingestion Process: The Great Reassembly**
This is a monumental data-curation effort. Each institution doesn't just digitize its artifacts; it ingests its entire research archive related to those artifacts.

1.  **The Louvre's Object for the *Mona Lisa*:**
    *   **Surface Layer:** The multi-spectral scan of the painting, compliant with the IIIF standard for interoperability. The official public-facing description.
    *   **Process Layer (The Object's Biography):** This layer becomes a deep history of the painting itself. Curators upload:
        *   The complete conservation history file: every report, chemical analysis, and X-ray scan from the last 100 years.
        *   The provenance records: scans of the original contracts and letters documenting the painting's ownership from King Francis I onward.
        *   All known preparatory sketches for the painting held by the Louvre.
        *   Scholarly articles published by Louvre curators about the painting.
    *   **Core Layer (The Deep Context of Time and Place):** Here, the Louvre ingests the surrounding historical world:
        *   Financial records from Renaissance Florence showing the economic world in which the commission took place.
        *   Social histories and genealogies of the Gherardini family (Lisa's family).
        *   Biographies and letters of other artists working in Florence at the same time, like Michelangelo and Raphael, showing the competitive and collaborative landscape.

2.  **The Royal Collection Trust's Anatomy Object:**
    *   **Surface:** The iconic "Vitruvian Man."
    *   **Process:** Not only da Vinci's 200+ anatomical drawings, but also the full digitized texts of Galen and other classical medical authorities that da Vinci was reacting to, creating a direct intellectual lineage.
    *   **Core:** Modern medical analysis, including MRI overlays, comparing his drawings to actual human anatomy, revealing his astonishing accuracy and his few, telling errors.

3.  **The Interlinking (The Semantic Weave):** This is the revolutionary act enabled by EverArchive. Using a shared ontology, curators across the world begin to weave the objects together.
    *   A curator at the Louvre creates a link from the hands of the *Mona Lisa* directly to three specific anatomical drawings in the Royal Collection Trust's object.
    *   An engineer studying the Codex Leicester (stewarded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) links da Vinci's theories on fluid dynamics and the reflection of light on water to the specific way the river is painted in the background of the *Mona Lisa*.
    *   A historian links a letter in the Core Layer of one object where da Vinci complains about a patron's slow payment to the official contract in the Process Layer of another, providing rich context to the financial realities of his life.

**The Result:** The system now contains not just a digital copy of da Vinci's work, but a rich, queryable, and verifiable simulation of his entire world and thought process. The provenance is no longer a simple list of owners; it's a deep web of social, economic, scientific, and artistic history.

### **Part 2: The Publishing Experience - The Living, Federated Exhibit**

#### **The Publishing Workflow & The Schema Projector**
*   **The Stewards' Action:** "The Leonardo Project" consortium launches a unified public portal by sharing a single, permanent EverArchive link: `davinci.everarchive.link`. This link points to a "master" object that serves as a directory to the federated collection.
*   **The Schema Projector in Action:** The power of EverArchive is that this single link can be rendered in countless ways depending on the user's needs.
    *   **Federated Gallery View (for the Public):** The default "Museum Exhibit Projector" renders a unified virtual exhibition. A user can see the *Mona Lisa* next to the anatomical drawing of a smile, next to the page from the Codex on optics—even though the physical objects are thousands of miles apart.
    *   **Scholarly View (for Researchers):** A credentialed researcher logs in. The same link now resolves to the "Interactive Scholarly Projector." This view overlays the painting with interactive "hotspots" that link to the source sketches, notebook pages, and conservation data.
    *   **Thematic View (for Students):** A student can append `/theme/flight` to the URL. The "Thematic Journey Projector" ignores the concept of individual objects and instead pulls every relevant asset from the entire federated collection—sketches of bird wings, designs for flying machines, notes on air resistance—and presents them as a single, coherent narrative on the theme of "Flight."
*   **The "Living Update" Experience:** A researcher in Florence discovers a previously unknown sketch believed to be related to the *Mona Lisa*. After verification by the consortium, the Uffizi adds the new scan to its object's Process Layer. The federated exhibit, the scholarly view, and even the thematic views that touch upon that period **are all instantly and automatically updated**. The global understanding of da Vinci evolves in real-time from a single, canonical edit.
*   **The Value Proposition:** This model respects the sovereignty and expertise of each institution while enabling a level of collaborative curation and public access that was previously impossible. It creates a living, global academic project, not just a static digital library.

### **Part 3: The Archival Act - Defining a Permanent Legacy**

**The Archival Workflow:**
The consortium agrees on a `v1.0` state for the federated knowledge graph, representing the most complete understanding of da Vinci's work as of that date. This becomes a permanent, citable version of the entire project.

**The Permissions & Consent Configuration:**
*   **Sovereign Permissions:** Each institution retains ultimate control over its own objects' permissions. The Louvre might make the *Mona Lisa*'s Process Layer fully public, while the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation might restrict access to the high-resolution Codex Leicester scans to credentialed scholars. The EverArchive system gracefully handles these federated permissions, showing users only what they are permitted to see from each source.
*   **Composable Media & Licensing:** The 3D models of da Vinci's inventions (war machines, flying machines, hydraulic pumps) are released into the public domain to inspire a new generation of engineers and artists.

**The Finalization:**
The entire federated graph, with its web of links and individual objects, is preserved on the network. The `v1.0` state is now immutable. Future discoveries will be added to a `v1.1` or `v2.0`, creating a perfect, versioned history of human understanding of da Vinci.

### **Part 4: The Consumption Experience - A Multi-Faceted Afterlife**

#### **Consumption Scenario A: The Human Connection (The Medical Student)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** A medical student studying the history of anatomy.
*   **The Discovery & Access:** The student accesses the public "Leonardo Project" portal.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** She is viewing one of the famous anatomical drawings of the human heart. In the viewer, she sees a verified link titled "Related Engineering Concepts." She clicks it. The viewer instantly pulls up a page from the Codex Atlanticus, stewarded by a different museum, showing da Vinci's engineering diagram for a four-chambered water pump, with notes on fluid dynamics.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The student has a flash of insight that transcends disciplinary boundaries. She realizes da Vinci wasn't just *drawing* the heart; he was *analyzing* it as a perfect piece of hydraulic engineering. She understands his art and his science not as two separate pursuits, but as a single, unified inquiry. The federated archive made this cross-disciplinary leap not only possible, but effortless.

#### **Consumption Scenario B: The AI / Agentic Web Connection (The Invention Simulator)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** An AI in 2077 designed to test historical engineering concepts.
*   **The Task & Access:** The AI is tasked with determining if da Vinci's "Aerial Screw" (the helicopter precursor) could have actually flown.
*   **The Synthesis & Insight:** The AI ingests the entire federated graph.
    1.  It pulls the main design sketch from the relevant codex (the **Surface**).
    2.  It finds his detailed studies on the properties of wood, canvas, and rope in the **Process Layer** of another object to understand the materials he would have used.
    3.  It pulls his notes on bird flight and air resistance from the **Core Layer** of a third object to understand his theoretical framework.
    4.  It ingests the deep contextual data about the climate and atmospheric density of 15th-century Florence.
    5.  It uses the **Schema Projector's "Physics Simulator" lens** to construct a virtual model based on these multi-source, authentic parameters. It runs a thousand simulations.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The AI provides a definitive answer: "Under 15th-century material constraints and atmospheric conditions, the machine was too heavy to generate lift. However, by substituting modern composite materials, the design is 78% viable." The AI has used the unified, deeply contextualized knowledge base to conduct a historical experiment that was never possible before, finally answering a 500-year-old question.

### **Conclusion: The Value of the Complete Journey**
For the consortium of world-leading institutions, EverArchive provides the neutral, decentralized ground for unprecedented collaboration. It allows them to weave their individual collections into a shared global tapestry of knowledge, enhancing the value of their own holdings without ceding sovereignty. For the world, the federated "Leonardo Project" object is the closest we can come to resurrecting a great mind. It allows anyone to navigate the intricate connections between art, science, engineering, and the historical world as da Vinci himself did, transforming a static legacy into a living, explorable universe of thought. It is the ultimate expression of Deep Authorship, applied retroactively to one of humanity's greatest creators.
