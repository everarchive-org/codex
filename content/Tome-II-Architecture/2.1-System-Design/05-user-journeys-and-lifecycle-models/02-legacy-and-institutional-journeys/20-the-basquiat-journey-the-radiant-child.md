### **Part 1: The Ingestion Experience - From World to Archive**

#### **The Curation Narrative: Decoding a Visual Encyclopedia**
Jean-Michel Basquiat's paintings are not single images; they are dense, layered tapestries of history, poetry, and street knowledge. A single canvas can contain references to ancient history, medical textbooks, jazz musicians, and the politics of his time. His process was a whirlwind of absorption and expression, drawing on everything around him. The challenge is that the "source code" for his work—the books he read, the music he listened to, the conversations he had—is ephemeral. The goal of this journey is to create a digital object that acts as a "Rosetta Stone" for his work, linking every cryptic word, symbol, and image on the canvas back to its source, preserving the incredible intellectual depth behind his raw, expressive power.

**The Ingestion Process: The Great Reassembly**
The Basquiat Estate and museum partners collaborate to build the definitive object for *"Untitled (Boxer)"*.

1.  **The Object for "Untitled (Boxer)":**
    *   **Surface Layer (The Final Product):** An ultra-high-resolution, multi-spectral scan of the 1982 painting. The official curatorial text and exhibition history.
    *   **Process Layer (The Verifiable Journey):** This layer reveals the physical and intellectual construction of the piece.
        *   **Underdrawings:** X-ray and infrared scans of the canvas revealing the layers of paint and earlier ideas that were covered up.
        *   **Source Material:** High-resolution scans of the specific pages from *Gray's Anatomy* that he referenced for the skeletal figures.
        *   **Studio Footage:** Digitized video clips of him working in his studio around the same time, showing his physical process of layering and collage.
        *   **Musical Influences:** A curated playlist of the bebop jazz (like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie) that he was known to listen to while painting, which is reflected in the work's frenetic energy.
    *   **Core Layer (The Deep Context):** This layer contains the cultural and personal world that fueled the work.
        *   **SAMO Graffiti:** A geo-tagged map of New York City showing the locations of his early "SAMO" graffiti with Fab 5 Freddy, including photographs and transcriptions of the poetic phrases.
        *   **Personal Notebooks:** Scans of his private notebooks, filled with the lists of words, poems, and drawings that would later appear in his paintings.
        *   **Oral Histories:** New, private interviews with his friends and contemporaries, capturing their recollections of his conversations, his influences, and the meaning behind some of his more cryptic symbols.

**The Interlinking (The Semantic Weave):**
This is a massive act of art historical decoding.
*   The word "Sugar Ray" crossed out on the canvas (**Surface**) is linked to historical boxing footage (**Process**) and to his notes on Black heroes and athletes (**Core**).
*   A specific anatomical drawing on the canvas is linked directly to the corresponding plate in the digitized copy of *Gray's Anatomy* (**Process**).
*   The crown motif is linked to a new oral history from a friend (**Core**) who explains what the symbol meant to Jean-Michel personally.

### **Part 2: The Publishing Experience - The Living Document**

#### **The Publishing Workflow & The Schema Projector**
*   **The Steward's Action:** MoMA integrates the EverArchive object into the painting's page on their official website.
*   **The Schema Projector in Action:**
    *   **The Annotated Canvas View:** This is the default projector. A user views the painting. As they mouse over any word or symbol, a pop-up appears with a scholarly annotation explaining its meaning and source, pulled directly from the linked data in the Process and Core layers.
    *   **The Thematic Explorer:** A user can select a theme like "Jazz." The projector then dims the painting slightly and highlights every single reference to jazz musicians and motifs, creating a visual overlay that reveals a hidden structural layer to the composition.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The painting is transformed from an intimidating, complex image into an infinitely explorable universe of meaning. It becomes an educational tool of unparalleled depth, inviting viewers to learn the language of the artist and understand the world through his eyes.

### **Part 3: The Archival Act - Defining a Permanent Legacy**

**The Archival Workflow:**
The consortium archives the `v1.0` object as the definitive scholarly and public resource for this masterpiece.

**The Permissions & Consent Configuration:**
*   **Sovereign Permissions:** The Surface Layer is public. The Process Layer is available under an educational license. The Core Layer, containing private oral histories, is restricted to vetted researchers.
*   **On-Chain Provenance:** The object's manifest is updated every time the physical painting is loaned to another museum, creating a permanent, on-chain exhibition history that travels with the digital object.

### **Part 4: The Consumption Experience - A Multi-Faceted Afterlife**

#### **Consumption Scenario A: The Human Connection (The High School Art Student)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** A high school student from a low-income neighborhood, "Jasmine," who feels disconnected from the art world.
*   **The Discovery & Access:** She accesses the public *Untitled (Boxer)* object on her school computer.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** She sees the raw, powerful painting. But then, using the Annotated Canvas viewer, she discovers that the "primitive" style she was taught to dismiss is actually a deeply intellectual reference to medical textbooks. She explores the "SAMO" map in the **Core Layer** and sees this same creative energy exploding on the streets of a city that looks like her own. She listens to the jazz playlist from the **Process Layer** while looking at the painting and feels the rhythm.
*   **The Value Proposition:** Jasmine sees herself in Basquiat. She realizes that art is not just for quiet, sterile museums—it is born from the streets, from music, from books, from the raw energy of life. The object has not just taught her about a painting; it has given her permission to see her own world as a source of powerful art.

#### **Consumption Scenario B: The AI / Agentic Web Connection (The Cultural Analyst AI)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** An AI model designed to trace the diffusion of cultural ideas.
*   **The Task & Access:** The AI ingests the Basquiat object.
*   **The Synthesis & Insight:** The AI performs a cross-modal analysis. It links the rhythmic, syncopated patterns in his brushstrokes and word placement to the exact bebop jazz tracks he was listening to from the **Process Layer**. It then analyzes his SAMO graffiti and finds the same poetic fragments appearing, on average, 18 months before they showed up in his major paintings. It creates a "meme-to-masterpiece" timeline.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The AI provides a data-driven, verifiable map of how ideas from street culture and music were synthesized into high art. It quantifies his creative process, proving that his work was a sophisticated sampling and remixing engine, not just a burst of chaotic expression. This provides a completely new and profound way to understand his genius.

### **Conclusion: The Value of the Complete Journey**
For the Basquiat Estate and its museum partners, EverArchive offers a way to finally document and share the incredible intellectual and cultural depth behind an artist often misunderstood. It provides the tools to make his dense, referential work accessible to everyone. For the world, the object ensures that Basquiat is remembered not just as a market phenomenon, but as one of the most brilliant and encyclopedic visual poets of his time, preserving the full context of his "radiant child" genius forever.
