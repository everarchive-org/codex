### **Part 1: The Ingestion Experience - From World to Archive**

#### **The Creation Narrative: The Rigor of Discovery**
Dr. Thorne's lab has been working for five years on a new method for gene editing. The process is a grueling cycle of hypothesis, experiment, failure, and refinement. Scientific discovery demands absolute rigor in its documentation. Every experiment, successful or failed, must be recorded. Every data point must be preserved. Proving *when* they made their breakthrough and being able to share their full methodology for peer review is critical for their credibility, for securing patents, and for the advancement of science itself.

**The Surface Layer (The Final Product):**
*   **What it is:** The final, peer-reviewed paper published in a top-tier scientific journal (e.g., *Nature*), presented as a PDF. The official patent filing for the "Helios" technique. A simplified press release explaining the breakthrough to the public.

**The Process Layer (The Verifiable Journey):**
*   **What's inside:** The complete, unabridged history of the discovery. This includes the digital lab notebooks of all four researchers on the team. All the raw output data from their gene sequencers and microscopes (terabytes of it). The code for the custom software they wrote to analyze the data. A full record of the 217 failed experiments that led to the final successful protocol. The full, unedited video of the single experiment that *finally* worked.
*   **The Capture Experience:** The lab uses EverArchive as their official electronic lab notebook (ELN). Every team member's notes are captured in a structured, timestamped format. Data from lab equipment is automatically ingested and linked to the specific experiment it came from. The system creates an **immutable, chronological chain of evidence** for the entire research project.

**The Core Layer (The Deep Context):**
*   **What's inside:** The initial, scribbled hypothesis on a napkin, scanned and timestamped. A private voice memo from Dr. Thorne to himself after a major funding rejection: *"They don't see it. They called it 'too speculative.' But I know the mechanism is sound. We have to find a way to fund the next six months ourselves."* The email threads showing the passionate, sometimes contentious, debates between team members about how to interpret a confusing data set.
*   **The Capture Experience:** Dr. Thorne uses the EverArchive mobile app to snap a photo of the napkin, preserving the "genesis moment" of the idea. The lab's email server has a plugin that allows team members to tag a specific thread and send an encrypted, privacy-preserving copy to the project's Core Layer, capturing the intellectual debate without exposing their entire inbox.

### **Part 2: The Publishing Experience - The Living Document**

#### **The Publishing Workflow & The Schema Projector**
*   **The Creator's Action:** The lab has a breakthrough but needs to submit it for peer review before public announcement. They create a "Pre-Print" folder in the `Surface Layer` containing the draft paper and a link to a curated subset of the most critical data from the `Process Layer`. They share a private, authenticated EverArchive link with the journal editors and peer reviewers.
*   **The Schema Projector in Action:**
    *   **Peer Review View:** The "Scholarly Projector" renders the paper alongside the supporting data. A reviewer can click on a graph in the paper, and the viewer will instantly show them the raw sequencer data and the analysis script from the Process Layer that generated that graph.
*   **The "Living Update" Experience:** A peer reviewer points out a needed clarification. Dr. Thorne's team updates the paper and the supporting data. The single link they shared with the journal now points to the revised version, ensuring all reviewers are working from the most current information without the confusion of multiple emailed PDF attachments.
*   **The Value Proposition:** This dramatically accelerates the peer review process and enhances its integrity. Reviewers can move beyond trusting the paper's claims to **verifying** the entire process, leading to more robust and credible science.

### **Part 3: The Archival Act - Defining a Permanent Legacy**

**The Archival Workflow:**
The paper is accepted and published. The patent is granted. The lab creates the final, public `v1.0` archive of the "Helios" discovery.

**The Permissions & Consent Configuration:**
*   **Sovereign Permissions:** The Surface Layer (published paper, patent) is made public. The entire Process Layer (all data, notes, and failed experiments) is also made public to support the principle of scientific reproducibility.
*   **The Core Layer** remains private to the original research team, but they set a 25-year time-lock, after which it will become available to historians of science.
*   **Composable Media & Licensing:** The software code is released under a permissive open-source license (GPL). The "Helios" protocol itself is made available for non-commercial research use globally, while commercial use requires a license from the university.
*   **AI Training Consent:** Set to **YES** for all forms of analysis and training, to accelerate further scientific discovery.

### **Part 4: The Consumption Experience - A Multi-Faceted Afterlife**

#### **Consumption Scenario A: The Human Connection (The Competing Lab)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** Another biology lab that initially struggled to reproduce the "Helios" technique.
*   **The Discovery & Access:** Instead of months of frustrating emails, they access the public **Process Layer** of the "Helios" object.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** They discover the treasure trove of the 217 failed experiments. By analyzing what *didn't* work for Dr. Thorne's team, they spot a subtle mistake in their own procedure. They realize they were using a reagent at a slightly different temperature, a detail not mentioned in the final paper but documented in the lab notes of a failed experiment.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The "negative data"—the record of failures—is just as valuable as the successful result. By preserving the *entire process*, Dr. Thorne's work doesn't just share a discovery; it teaches the world how to avoid the pitfalls on the way to it, saving other researchers years of wasted effort.

#### **Consumption Scenario B: The Schema Projector as an Interactive Paper**
*   **Consumer Persona:** An undergraduate biology student.
*   **The Task & Access:** They access the public object.
*   **The Synthesis & Insight:** The "Reproducible Research Projector" renders the scientific paper as an interactive document. The student clicks on a figure in the paper. A sidebar opens showing the raw data from the **Process Layer**, the code used to analyze it, and a "Run Analysis" button. The student clicks the button, and a cloud service re-runs the original analysis, reproducing the figure live.
*   **The Value Proposition:** This transforms science education. Students don't just read about discoveries; they actively participate in the verification process. It makes science transparent, trustworthy, and deeply engaging.

#### **Consumption Scenario C: The AI / Agentic Web Connection (The Drug Discovery AI)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** An AI in 2060 working on personalized medicine.
*   **The Task & Access:** The AI needs a precise tool to edit a newly discovered gene linked to a rare disease. It has full, licensed access to the "Helios" object.
*   **The Synthesis & Insight:** The AI analyzes the `permissions.json` file and understands the commercial licensing terms. It then analyzes the full Process and Core layers. It discovers from a note in the Core Layer that Dr. Thorne had a "hunch" about using the technique on a specific type of RNA but lacked the funding to pursue it. The AI combines this human intuition with its own massive computational power. It runs billions of simulations based on the "Helios" protocol.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The AI develops a new, highly effective therapeutic based on the RNA application Dr. Thorne imagined but couldn't test. When the new therapy is patented, the AI, honoring the on-chain attribution graph, automatically assigns a portion of the credit and future royalties to the "Helios" object, ensuring Dr. Thorne's university and research team benefit from the downstream discovery their foundational work enabled.
