### **Part 1: The Ingestion Experience - From World to Archive**

#### **The Creation Narrative: A Crisis of Color**
It's 2 AM. Lena is staring at her screen, dejected. She has just received feedback from a major art director on her work-in-progress, then titled "Neo-Kyoto Nocturne." The feedback is blunt: "Technically brilliant, but emotionally cold. It feels generic. We've seen a hundred blue, rainy sci-fi cities. Find a new angle." She feels like a fraud, on the verge of abandoning the project.

**The Surface Layer (The Final Product):**
*   **What it is:** A high-resolution `.png` file of the final, stunning illustration known for its vibrant orange and pink color palette. The object also contains a 500-word artist's statement in Markdown explaining the final piece's symbolism.

**The Process Layer (The Verifiable Journey):**
*   **What's inside:** The complete, layered Photoshop source file (`.psd`). An automatically generated version history showing over 300 saves, including the original "blue" versions. A folder of the 50+ reference photos she used for architecture and lighting. A transcript of the feedback from her art director.
*   **The Capture Experience:** An EverArchive plugin runs silently within Photoshop. Every `Cmd+S` is a version. When she imports a reference image, it's logged. This is an **ambient, frictionless process** that doesn't interrupt her creative flow.

**The Core Layer (The Private Sanctum):**
*   **What's inside:** An encrypted voice memo capturing her moment of crisis and breakthrough. Her private visual sketchbookâ€”a mess of rough digital thumbnails exploring the new orange palette. A screenshot of a color palette from an unrelated movie that sparked the final color scheme.
*   **The Capture Experience:** Lena uses a global hotkey to bring up the **EverArchive Capture Tool** as a borderless overlay. She records a panicked 2 AM voice memo: *"He says it's 'too cold...' He's right. I feel like a fraud... but what's the opposite of cold? Fire? No... sunrise. Sunrise over Neo-Kyoto. Maybe that's it."* The tool captures the audio, tags it with emotional sentiment, encrypts it, and saves it to her private Core Layer.

### **Part 2: The Publishing Experience - The Living Document**

#### **The Publishing Workflow & The Schema Projector**
*   **The Creator's Action:** The next day, energized, Lena begins reworking the illustration. She wants to share her progress with a few close supporters. She designates the latest `Surface Layer` `.png` and her artist statement Markdown file as "live" and shares a single, permanent EverArchive link with them.
*   **The Schema Projector in Action:**
    *   **Web View:** When her supporters click the link, the default "HTML Projector" renders her illustration and artist statement as a clean, elegant portfolio page.
    *   **Presentation View:** For a virtual studio visit, Lena appends `/slides` to the link. The "Slideshow Projector" instantly renders the same image and text as a simple, full-screen presentation.
*   **The "Living Update" Experience:** As Lena saves new versions of the illustration over the next week, the portfolio page her supporters are viewing **updates automatically** each time they refresh. The single link always points to her latest public iteration. They can watch the piece come to life day by day.
*   **The Value Proposition:** Lena is liberated from the tedious cycle of exporting JPEGs, uploading them to a portfolio site, and sending out update emails. She focuses on her canonical source file in her Deep Authorship Package, and EverArchive handles the live presentation. It's a powerful tool for her active project.

### **Part 3: The Archival Act - Defining a Permanent Legacy**

**The Archival Workflow:**
The piece is finished and published, launching her career. Months later, she decides to formally "freeze" this version as `v1.0` and set its permanent rules. She initiates the "Preserve v1.0" workflow in the tool.

**The Permissions & Consent Configuration:**
*   **Sovereign Permissions:** The live link now resolves to this immutable `v1.0`. Her Core Layer remains private, but she flags the "sunrise" voice memo as a sharable insight. The Process Layer is set to "Educational Use Only."
*   **Composable Media & Licensing:** She navigates to a sub-folder in her `Process Layer` containing her custom texture brushes. She applies a **`CC BY-NC` (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial)** license to this folder. The license requires any derivative work to embed a cryptographic link back to this parent object.
*   **AI Training Consent:** She sets `Allow AI analysis for non-commercial research?` to **YES**, but `Allow for generative "remixing" in my style?` to **NO**.

**The Finalization:**
With one click, these rules are bundled, signed, and the `v1.0` object is immutably preserved.

### **Part 4: The Consumption Experience - A Multi-Faceted Afterlife**

#### **Consumption Scenario A: The Human Connection (The Art Student)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** An aspiring digital artist, "Ravi."
*   **The Discovery & Access:** Ravi discovers Lena's work and gains educational access to the archived `v1.0` object.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** In the EverArchive Viewer, Ravi scrubs the creation timeline from the **Process Layer**. He sees the pivot from the blue to the orange version. A small icon appears on the timeline at the exact moment of the pivot. He clicks it and hears Lena's 2 AM voice memo from her **Core Layer**.
*   **The Value Proposition:** Ravi feels a profound connection. He learns that a masterpiece was born from a moment of crisis and vulnerability. This insight into the *real* creative process is a more valuable lesson than any technical tutorial.

#### **Consumption Scenario B: The Composable Creation (The Attribution Chain)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** Ravi, the same art student, inspired by Lena's work.
*   **The Discovery & Licensing:** While exploring the Process Layer, the Viewer highlights the "Brushes" sub-folder with a "CC-BY-NC License" badge. Ravi legally downloads one of Lena's unique texture brushes.
*   **The Act of Creation:** He uses the brush in his own new artwork. When he archives his piece, his Deep Authorship Package manifest automatically includes a cryptographic reference: `{"influence_of": "ever:archive:id/<Lena's_Object_ID>", "assets_used": ["texture_brush_04.abr"]}`.
*   **The Value Proposition:** This creates an **immutable, on-chain "chain of art."** Anyone can now cryptographically verify that his work was built on the shoulders of Lena's, creating a transparent and honorable creative lineage that is part of the permanent record.

#### **Consumption Scenario C: The AI / Agentic Web Connection**
*   **Consumer Persona:** A museum curation AI.
*   **The Task & Access:** The AI is asked to "explain the significance" of "Sunrise over Neo-Kyoto." It accesses the archived object, respecting all of Lena's permissions.
*   **The Synthesis & Insight:** The AI tells a story: "This work is significant not only for its aesthetic but for the creative pivot it represents. It began as a blue, nocturnal scene [displays the v1 image]. Following critical feedback, the artist underwent a period of self-doubt [plays the authorized Core Layer audio clip], which led to the final, celebrated version."
*   **The Value Proposition:** The AI acts as a master storyteller, using the full, layered context to enrich human understanding. It also demonstrates an ethical AI ecosystem, as it would refuse any request to generate new images in Lena's style, because it can read and respect the "NO" toggle in her `permissions.json`.

### **Conclusion: The Value of the Complete Journey**
For Lena, EverArchive is not just a backup. It is a living portfolio during creation, a sovereign vault upon completion, and a source of continuing legacy and influence long after. By preserving the full story, her final work becomes infinitely richer, more valuable, and more inspirational to the next generation of creators.
