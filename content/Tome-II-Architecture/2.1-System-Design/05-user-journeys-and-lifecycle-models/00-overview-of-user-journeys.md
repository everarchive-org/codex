### **Preamble: The Stories We Build For**
This collection of documents is the narrative soul of the EverArchive project. It answers the fundamental question: "Who are we building this for, and how will it change their life's work?"

Each document is a **User Journey**, a story following a specific person or institution. These journeys trace the **complete lifecycle** of a creative work—from its initial spark of inspiration, through the messy process of creation, to its permanent archival and its future consumption by others.

To capture this full lifecycle, we use a methodology we call **Deep Authorship**: a three-layer model (Core, Process, and Surface) that preserves not just the final product, but the verifiable journey and private context behind it.

These stories are our most important architectural guide. They ground our technical work in tangible human needs and provide the definitive "why" for everything we build.

### **Part 1: Featured Creator Journeys**
These scenarios showcase how different creators experience the Deep Authorship model.

#### **Lena, The Digital Illustrator: "Sunrise over Neo-Kyoto"**
Lena created a stunning piece that launched her career, but the final image hides the true story: a crisis of confidence after her art director rejected the initial concept, captured in a panicked 2 AM voice memo that reveals the true source of her creative breakthrough.
> This journey demonstrates how preserving vulnerability can illuminate genius.

#### **Javier, The Indie Musician: "Echo in the Static"**
Javier wrote a hauntingly simple song praised for its raw emotional honesty. His private journal reveals the "terrifying but right" decision to delete layers of complexity, showing that the process of subtraction is as vital as the act of creation.
> This journey shows that great work often requires courageous creative choices.

#### **Aisha, The Open-Source Developer: "Graphica" Library**
Aisha's elegant open-source library is the product of intense community debate and private technical doubt. Her journey shows how preserving the "why" behind the code—the GitHub issues, whiteboard photos, and private developer diaries—is crucial for future maintainers.
> This journey illustrates that even technical work is a deeply human process of doubt and compromise.

### **Part 2: The Consumption Experience - The Future of Understanding**
The value is truly unlocked when these rich objects are experienced by others, allowing for a profound human connection with the creator's process or enabling an AI to augment our understanding of a work by telling the full story of its creation. This is the later stage of the work's lifecycle.

### **Part 3: The Value of the Deep Authorship Model**
*   **The Surface Layer** is the public artifact, the cover of the book.
*   **The Process Layer** is the verifiable story, the book itself.
*   **The Core Layer** is the creator's private diary, the human heart of the work.
