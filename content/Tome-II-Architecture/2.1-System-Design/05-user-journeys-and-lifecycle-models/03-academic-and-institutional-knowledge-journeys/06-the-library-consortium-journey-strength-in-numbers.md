# 2.5.43 The Library Consortium Journey: "Strength in Numbers"

**Persona:** "The Oberlin Digital Alliance," a consortium of 15 independent liberal arts colleges who have pooled their resources to tackle digital preservation.
**Work:** Creating a shared, sovereign, and sustainable preservation infrastructure that meets the needs of all member institutions without requiring a massive central IT staff.

---

### **Primitives & Technologies Demonstrated**

*   **Ingestion Primitives (Automation & Intelligence):**
    *   `Steward-Assisted Ingestion` (provided centrally by the consortium)
    *   `Template-Based Object Creation` (e.g., "Faculty Papers," "Student Thesis," "College History")
    *   `Policy-Based Ingestion`
*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   `Federated Stewardship`: The central innovation of this journey. The consortium acts as a "Steward" entity, while each college remains sovereign over its own content.
    *   `Shared Infrastructure, Sovereign Control`: The core value proposition.
*   **Schema Projector Lenses:**
    *   `Consortium-Wide Discovery Portal`
    *   `Individual Institutional Portal`
    *   `Cross-Collection Exhibit Builder`
*   **Licensing & Economic Primitives:**
    *   `Tiered Access Licensing`
*   **Standards & Compliance:**
    *   `OAIS Model Alignment`
    *   `NDSA Levels of Preservation`
    *   `Metadata Crosswalk (MARC, Dublin Core)`

### **Part 1: The Ingestion Experience - From World to Archive**

#### **The Curation Narrative: The Agony of Shared Systems**
The Oberlin Digital Alliance was formed out of necessity. None of the 15 member colleges could afford a robust digital preservation system on their own. Their first attempt was to co-fund a single, centralized instance of an open-source repository platform. It quickly became a nightmare. One college's custom metadata schema broke another's. A software update required by one member would disrupt the workflow of another. The central IT staff (one part-time developer) became a permanent bottleneck. They need a system that gives them the economic benefits of collaboration without the technical and political headaches of a single, shared system.

**The Ingestion Process: Federated, Not Centralized**
The Alliance signs up as an EverArchive "Consortium Steward." This provides a new model.

1.  **The Steward's Role:** The Alliance's central staff (now just one "Digital Stewardship Coordinator") doesn't manage the data. Their job is to support the members. They create a library of shared **Templates** and **Policies** based on best practices, which any member college can adopt.
2.  **The Member College's Sovereignty:** Each of the 15 colleges gets its own sovereign, independent space within the EverArchive ecosystem. Their archivists (often just a single librarian) use the Alliance-provided templates to ingest their own collections.
    *   **Amherst College** ingests their Emily Dickinson collection using the "Literary Papers" template.
    *   **Wesleyan University** ingests their film archive using the "Analog Media" template.
    *   **Oberlin College** ingests their student music recitals.
3.  **The Capture Experience:** A librarian at Oberlin wants to archive a student's senior thesis. They log in to their own institutional portal, select the "Student Thesis" template provided by the Alliance, and are walked through the **`Guided Ingest`** workflow. The final Deep Authorship Package is stored in *Oberlin's* sovereign archive, but its preservation is backed by the shared infrastructure and its metadata is available to the consortium.

**The Result:** The technical bottleneck is gone. Each college controls its own destiny, its own metadata, and its own content, while benefiting from shared templates, expertise, and the cost-savings of the underlying shared storage infrastructure.

### **Part 2: The Publishing Experience - The Living Document**

#### **The Publishing Workflow & The Schema Projector**
*   **The Steward's Action:** The Alliance wants to showcase the combined strength of their collections. They create a "Consortium Portal" by sharing a single EverArchive link.
*   **The Schema Projector in Action:** This is where the federated model shines.
    *   **Consortium-Wide Discovery Portal:** The "Federated Search Projector" allows a user to search across the public collections of *all 15 colleges* at once. It can dynamically pull and display content from 15 different sovereign archives into a single, seamless user interface.
    *   **Individual Institutional Portal:** Simultaneously, Amherst College can use the exact same underlying object but apply the "Single Institution Projector" to render a website that *only* shows their own collection, for their own alumni and students.
*   **The "Living Update" Experience:** Wesleyan adds a newly digitized silent film to their archive. That film instantly becomes discoverable through both the main Consortium Portal and Wesleyan's individual portal. One ingestion action serves multiple, customized publishing endpoints.
*   **The Value Proposition:** This model offers the best of both worlds: institutional autonomy and collective strength. Each college maintains its own brand and control, while their combined collections create a scholarly resource far greater than any one of them could build alone.

### **Part 3: The Archival Act - Defining a Permanent Legacy**

**The Archival Workflow:**
The archival act is distributed. Each member college is responsible for finalizing and preserving its own objects according to its own policies, but they are all supported by the consortium's shared preservation standards and infrastructure.

### **Part 4: The Consumption Experience - A Multi-Faceted Afterlife**

#### **Consumption Scenario A: The Human Connection (The Cross-Disciplinary Researcher)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** A professor studying the influence of the American Transcendentalist movement.
*   **The Discovery & Access:** He visits the main Consortium Portal.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** He searches for "Emerson." The search results return not just letters from Emerson at one college, but also lecture notes from a philosophy professor at another, a student's musical composition inspired by *Nature* at a third, and botanical drawings from a fourth college's science department that were created by a contemporary of Thoreau.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The federated search has broken down the institutional silos that mirror academic disciplines. The professor can now trace the influence of a single idea across literature, philosophy, music, and science within a single interface. This enables a level of cross-disciplinary discovery that would have previously required years of travel and separate archival research.

#### **Consumption Scenario B: The Schema Projector as a Collaborative Exhibit Builder**
*   **Consumer Persona:** A group of students from three different member colleges, tasked with co-curating a digital exhibit for a shared course.
*   **The Task & Access:** They are given access to the "Cross-Collection Exhibit Builder" projector.
*   **The Synthesis & Insight:** The student from Amherst pulls in a poem by an alumna. The student from Wesleyan adds a film made by a contemporary. The student from Oberlin adds a piece of music from their conservatory that responds to the same theme. They write collaborative interpretive text.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The students can create a rich, multi-media, and multi-institutional exhibit without needing to transfer files or build a website. They are learning to think and work across institutional boundaries, using the consortium's shared collection as a creative palette.

#### **Consumption Scenario C: The AI / Agentic Web Connection (The Collections Analyst AI)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** An AI assistant for the Consortium's Stewardship Coordinator.
*   **The Task & Access:** The Coordinator asks, "Identify our collection strengths and weaknesses across the entire Alliance."
*   **The Synthesis & Insight:** The AI ingests the public metadata from all 15 institutional archives. It performs a topic modeling analysis and generates a visual report. It concludes: "The Alliance has a world-class, globally unique collection in 19th-century American poetry. However, we have a significant gap in materials related to post-1980 digital art. I recommend a targeted acquisition initiative in this area."
*   **The Value Proposition:** The federated but interconnected nature of the data allows the consortium to perform strategic analysis on their collective holdings for the first time. They can make informed, data-driven decisions about future acquisitions and fundraising, strengthening the entire network.

### **Conclusion: The Value of the Complete Journey**
For the library consortium, EverArchive solves their core political and technical dilemma. It provides a way to achieve the economic benefits of shared infrastructure without sacrificing the institutional sovereignty that is so vital to their identity. It replaces a fragile, bottlenecked central system with a resilient, federated network. For the individual members, it gives them access to world-class preservation tools on a liberal arts budget. For the world of scholarship, it unlocks the immense, previously siloed, collective knowledge of these great institutions.
