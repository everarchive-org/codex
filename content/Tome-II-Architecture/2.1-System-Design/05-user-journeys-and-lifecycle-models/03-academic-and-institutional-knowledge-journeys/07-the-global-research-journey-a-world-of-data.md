### **Part 1: The Ingestion Experience - From World to Archive**

#### **The Curation Narrative: The Gordian Knot of Global Compliance**
Project Tundra is a triumph of international scientific collaboration. Researchers from three continents are working together to tackle one of the world's most urgent problems. But their success has created a compliance nightmare. The US team's data must adhere to NSF's open data policies. The German team's data, which includes information on research subjects, falls under the strict privacy rules of GDPR and must not leave the EU. The UK data has its own funder requirements for long-term retention. They need to preserve their work as a single, coherent, intellectual entity, but their data is legally forbidden from residing in a single, centralized location.

**The Ingestion Process: Virtual Unification, Physical Distribution**
Project Tundra becomes a "Federated Steward" in EverArchive, with each national team acting as a sovereign node within the federation.

1.  **The Master Object:** The project lead creates a "master" Deep Authorship Package for "Project Tundra." This object doesn't hold the bulk data itself; it holds the project's charter, its list of members, and, crucially, **links** to the sovereign objects managed by each national team.
2.  **The National Objects & Geo-Aware Policies:**
    *   **The US Team:** They create the "Tundra-US" object. They apply a **Policy**: "Ingest all satellite data. Ensure preservation occurs only on US-domiciled EverArchive storage nodes. Make all data public after a 1-year embargo, as per NSF rules."
    *   **The German Team:** They create the "Tundra-DE" object. They apply a **Policy**: "Ingest all ground sensor and human subject data. Ensure preservation occurs *only* on EU-domiciled nodes. Use AI to scan for and pseudonymize all PII. Data access requires GDPR-compliant authentication."
    *   **The UK Team:** They create the "Tundra-UK" object with a policy reflecting UKRI's 10-year retention mandate.
3.  **The Capture Experience:** The process is automated. Data from a sensor array in Siberia, managed by the German team, is automatically routed to an EverArchive node in Frankfurt. Satellite data from a NASA feed, managed by the US team, is routed to a node in Virginia. The physical bits never illegally cross a border. However, the manifest of each object is updated in the decentralized index, and the "master" object links them all together.

**The Result:** A single, virtual, intellectually coherent project is created from physically and legally distinct parts. The compliance knot is untied.

### **Part 2: The Publishing Experience - The Living Document**

#### **The Publishing Workflow & The Schema Projector**
*   **The Steward's Action:** The Project Tundra lead shares the link to the "master" object: `project-tundra.everarchive.link`.
*   **The Schema Projector in Action:**
    *   **Unified Data Portal:** The default projector for the master object is a powerful "Federated Data Portal." It shows a map of the Arctic. A user can draw a square on the map over Northern Siberia. The projector sends queries to all three national objects. It seamlessly pulls the US satellite imagery, the German ground sensor data, and the UK climate models for that specific region and presents them as a single, unified dataset to the user.
*   **The "Living Update" Experience:** The UK team runs a new, more accurate climate model. They update their "Tundra-UK" object. The next time a researcher visits the master portal and queries that region, the **Unified Data Portal automatically pulls and displays the new UK model**, noting that it has been updated.
*   **The Value Proposition:** Researchers can interact with the entire project as if it were a single database, while the underlying architecture transparently handles the complex jurisdictional requirements. It provides seamless access without violating a single data sovereignty law.

### **Part 3: The Archival Act - Defining a Permanent Legacy**

**The Archival Workflow:**
The project's initial funding period ends. The consortium declares the `v1.0` state of the federated object as the official, citable data release.

**The Permissions & Consent Configuration:**
*   Each national object retains its own permissions, governed by its specific funding mandates (NSF, GDPR, UKRI). The master object acts as a directory that respects and enforces these federated permissions.
*   The act of archival triggers the **`Funder Compliance Report Generation`** projector for each national team, providing them with the automated reports they need.

### **Part 4: The Consumption Experience - A Multi-Faceted Afterlife**

#### **Consumption Scenario A: The Human Connection (The Policy Maker)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** An aide to a senator on the Environment Committee.
*   **The Discovery & Access:** She needs to understand the real-world impact of permafrost melt in a specific region of Alaska. She accesses the public Project Tundra portal.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** She uses the map interface to zoom in on the district of a key political rival. The portal pulls the US satellite data (**Process**) showing dramatic landscape changes over 5 years. It overlays this with the German ground sensor data (**Process**) showing methane release spikes, and the UK climate model (**Process**) predicting future shoreline erosion.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The aide can now go into a hearing with a simple, powerful, and undeniable visualization built from the unified data of three nations. She can say, "This isn't a partisan issue. Here is the combined data from American, British, and German scientists showing the direct impact on your colleague's district." The federated archive has become a powerful tool for non-partisan, evidence-based policy making.

#### **Consumption Scenario B: The AI / Agentic Web Connection (The Global Climate AI)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** The primary AI for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2050.
*   **The Task & Access:** The IPCC AI is tasked with creating the most accurate model of global climate change yet. It requests access to the full Project Tundra federated object.
*   **The Synthesis & Insight:** The AI's access request is handled automatically. The system grants it access to the public US and UK data. For the German data, it requires the AI to present a GDPR-compliant "data processing" credential. Once verified, access is granted. The AI then ingests the complete, multi-source dataset. It discovers a subtle correlation between a specific type of solar radiation (from the US satellite data) and methane release spikes (from the German ground sensors) that was not visible to any single team in isolation.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The AI makes a significant new scientific discovery by being the first "entity" that can legally and technically analyze the *entire* dataset in one place. The federated architecture of EverArchive has enabled a new, higher level of scientific synthesis that was previously impossible due to legal and national data silos.

### **Conclusion: The Value of the Complete Journey**
For the Project Tundra consortium, EverArchive is the only platform capable of solving their critical data sovereignty and compliance challenges. It allows them to function as a unified scientific project while respecting the laws of their individual nations. For the world, it provides a model for future global collaborations, ensuring that the most important data about our planet can be preserved, shared, and analyzed safely and ethically, breaking down the political barriers that often hinder scientific progress.
