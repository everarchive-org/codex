### **Part 1: The Ingestion Experience - From World to Archive**

#### **The Curation Narrative: The Scarcity and Pragmatism Paradigm**
Sarah is the sole guardian of her college's history. Her most valuable asset is the newly donated collection of a beloved poet's papers. It's a treasure trove that could be the basis for a dozen student theses. But her reality is one of scarcity. She has no dedicated budget for digital preservation, no specialized equipment, and her only help comes from well-meaning but untrained student workers. Her current "workflow" is a chaotic mix of spreadsheets and network drives, and she lives in fear of a student accidentally deleting a folder or creating metadata so inconsistent that the collection becomes unusable. She needs a system that provides structure, safety, and a professional result without requiring a professional budget or a team of experts.

**The Ingestion Process: The "Student-Proof" Workflow**
Sarah subscribes to EverArchive's affordable "Institutional" tier. The process is designed to provide maximum leverage for her tiny team.

1.  **Template & Policy:** An EverArchive Steward helps Sarah set up a **"Literary Papers Collection" Template**. This template defines the required folder structure (`/Manuscripts`, `/Correspondence`, `/Photos`) and a simplified metadata schema based on Dublin Core.
2.  **Guided Ingest:** This is the core of the solution. Sarah's student workers don't get a complex, open-ended interface. They log in to a **`Guided Ingest & QC Workflow`**.
    *   **The Interface:** The tool presents a simple, wizard-like checklist: "Select Item Type: (Letter / Manuscript / Photo)."
    *   **Step-by-Step:** If a student selects "Letter," the tool walks them through it: "1. Scan the front of the letter. (Upload here)." "2. Scan the back." "3. Transcribe the date from the top right corner into this box: [YYYY-MM-DD]." "4. Transcribe the recipient's name."
    *   **Automated Assistance:** As the student uploads the scan, the system's **`AI-Assisted Metadata`** tool performs OCR and suggests the date, pre-filling the box for the student to verify.
3.  **QC & Validation:** After a student completes a batch, Sarah gets a notification. She opens the QC dashboard. She doesn't have to re-check every single field. The **`Automated QC`** has already flagged the three entries where the student entered a date in the wrong format and the one scanned image that was too low-resolution.

**The Layers of a Literary Collection:**
*   **Surface Layer:** The final, typed versions of the poet's most famous poems. A curated selection of her most iconic photographs.
*   **Process Layer:** Scans of the multiple, heavily-edited handwritten drafts for each poem. The complete, unedited collection of photographs. Scans of letters from her editor with suggestions and critiques.
*   **Core Layer:** Her personal, private diaries (scanned and encrypted). Letters to her family discussing her struggles with writer's block.

### **Part 2: The Publishing Experience - The Living Document**

#### **The Publishing Workflow & The Schema Projector**
*   **The Steward's Action:** As the students complete the digitization of a portion of the collection, Sarah wants to make it immediately available for use in classes. She selects the completed items and designates them as "live" in the object's public `Surface Layer`.
*   **The Schema Projector in Action:**
    *   **Digital Special Collection Viewer:** The "Special Collection Projector" instantly renders the material as a professional, searchable online archive. A literature professor can now direct their students to the site.
    *   **Student Curation Exhibit Builder:** A professor assigns a final project where students must curate their own digital exhibit. The students use a special Schema Projector lens that allows them to select items from the archive, write their own interpretive text, and generate a unique URL for their exhibit, all without needing any web development skills.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The archive becomes a dynamic pedagogical tool from day one. It's not just a place to store things; it's a platform for teaching digital literacy, curatorial skills, and primary source analysis. Sarah has empowered her entire campus with a resource she could never have built on her own.

### **Part 3: The Archival Act - Defining a Permanent Legacy**

**The Archival Workflow:**
After a year, the entire collection is digitized. Sarah declares the `v1.0` object complete and initiates the formal preservation process.

**The Permissions & Consent Configuration:**
*   **Sovereign Permissions:** The Surface Layer is public. The Process Layer is available to anyone with a college network login. The Core Layer (the diaries) is restricted to applications approved by the library director.
*   **NDSA Level Achievement:** The archival act automatically generates a report showing that the collection now meets **NDSA Level 2** for preservation (e.g., bit-level fixity is checked, data is stored in multiple locations), a huge leap from their previous Level 0 status.

### **Part 4: The Consumption Experience - A Multi-Faceted Afterlife**

#### **Consumption Scenario A: The Human Connection (The Undergraduate Student)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** An undergraduate English major, "Maria."
*   **The Discovery & Access:** She is using the public "Special Collection Viewer" for a class assignment.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** She is studying her favorite poem. She reads the clean, final version (Surface). But then she clicks the "View Process" button. The viewer shows her five earlier, handwritten drafts from the **Process Layer**. She sees the poet's handwriting, the crossed-out words, the frantic scribbles in the margins. She sees a line that was once in the first stanza move to the last. She sees the struggle.
*   **The Value Proposition:** The poem is no longer a static, intimidating piece of "great literature." It's a living, breathing thing that was wrestled into existence by a real person. Maria feels empowered. She realizes that writing is about revision and hard work, not just innate genius. This changes her relationship with writing forever.

#### **Consumption Scenario B: The AI / Agentic Web Connection (The Digital Humanist's Tool)**
*   **Consumer Persona:** A visiting Digital Humanities scholar.
*   **The Task & Access:** The scholar wants to analyze the poet's use of color imagery over her entire career.
*   **The Synthesis & Insight:** She doesn't need to manually read every poem. She uses an AI analysis tool that she points at the college's EverArchive repository. The AI ingests the entire collection. Because of the **AI-Assisted Metadata** applied during ingestion, every manuscript is already tagged with its date. The AI performs a textual analysis, tracking the frequency of words like "red," "blue," "gold," etc., over time.
*   **The Value Proposition:** In an afternoon, the AI generates a complete data visualization showing a clear shift in the poet's color palette after a trip to Mexico documented in her letters. The scholar has the foundation for a groundbreaking new paper. The "low-level" metadata work done by Sarah's student workers, empowered by the system's AI, has enabled high-level scholarly discovery.

### **Conclusion: The Value of the Complete Journey**
For Sarah, the "Lone Archivist," EverArchive is a force multiplier. It provides the structure, automation, and "guardrails" that allow her to manage a major project with a non-expert team, producing a world-class, professional result on a shoestring budget. It solves her biggest pain points: workflow chaos, quality control, and the fear of data loss. For the college, it transforms a dormant collection into a dynamic teaching tool, enriching the educational mission and making its unique treasures accessible to the world.
