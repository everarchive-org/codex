# Software Tool: EverScan
**Tool ID**: 17  
**Category**: Verification & Monitoring  
**Development Status**: Specification Complete  
**Last Updated**: July 6, 2025
## Tool Overview
### Primary Purpose
*Unified explorer and audit dashboard providing comprehensive transparency, verification, and health monitoring for the entire EverArchive ecosystem.*
EverScan serves as the "single pane of glass" for the ecosystem, allowing all users—from creators and researchers to institutional partners and system administrators—to verify the integrity, provenance, and physical status of preserved assets. It makes the abstract promises of "verifiable provenance" and "decentralized permanence" tangible and observable.
### Target Users & Contexts
*Who uses this tool and in what scenarios*
- **Primary Users**: Researchers verifying provenance, institutional partners auditing custody, system administrators monitoring network health
- **Secondary Users**: Creators confirming their work is safe, the public exploring creative lineage, compliance officers generating reports
- **Use Contexts**: Verifying an object's storage locations, exploring the version history of a creative work, monitoring the uptime of storage nodes, auditing institutional compliance
### Consolidated Capabilities
*The main things this tool enables users to accomplish*
1. **Provenance Exploration**: Visually explore the complete version history and creative lifecycle of any archived object through interactive lineage graphs and verify its cryptographic authorship signatures.
2. **Storage Verification**: Confirm the existence and integrity of an object's data shards across the multi-tier storage network, including the EverNode mesh, the Arweave blockchain, and physical vault manifests.
3. **Network Auditing**: Monitor the real-time health, geographic distribution, and performance of the entire EverNode storage network, providing a comprehensive dashboard for system administrators and institutional partners.
## User Journey Enablement
### Workflow Transformation
*How this tool changes what's possible for users*
**Before This Tool**:
- The safety and location of preserved data is an abstract promise with no way to verify it.
- Proving authorship or creative history is a complex, manual process of assembling disparate files and records.
- The health of the distributed storage network is a black box, opaque to users and partners.
- Institutional compliance requires manual audits and report generation.
**With This Tool**:
- Creators and researchers have absolute, on-demand proof of an object's integrity, history, and storage status.
- Interactive lineage graphs make the entire creative process visible and understandable at a glance.
- Institutional partners have a "custody dashboard" to prove they are fulfilling their storage obligations.
- System health is transparent, fostering trust and enabling proactive network management.
### Source Scenario Examples
*Concrete examples from source materials showing tool value*
#### **Scenario 1: The Researcher's Inquiry**
- **Source Context**: A historian in 2040 finds a work on the major digital libraries and follows a link to its EverArchive record.
- **Challenge Addressed**: Researchers need to see beyond the final artifact to understand its full context, including drafts, influences, and creator notes.
- **Value Delivered**: EverScan provides an interactive "lineage explorer" that displays the complete version history, associated files, and verifiable authorship, turning a simple artifact into a rich historical record.
- **Source Reference**: Original Index (Researcher Journey)
#### **Scenario 2: The Institutional Audit**
- **Source Context**: A university library, acting as a node operator, needs to verify its role in co-custodying a collection.
- **Challenge Addressed**: Institutional partners require a simple, reliable way to audit their own performance and demonstrate compliance with the DAO's requirements.
- **Value Delivered**: EverScan's "custody dashboard" shows the partner which data shards they are responsible for, confirms their custody attestations, and provides a clear report of their contribution to the network's health.
- **Source Reference**: Original Index (Institutional Partner Journey)
## Institutional & Scale Benefits
### Organizational Value
*How this tool serves institutional and group needs*
- **Trust & Transparency**: Provides undeniable proof of preservation, which is critical for securing partnerships with risk-averse institutions.
- **Compliance & Reporting**: Automates the generation of audit reports for standards like TRAC and PREMIS, drastically reducing administrative overhead.
- **Operational Excellence**: Enables proactive network management by making storage health and performance metrics visible to administrators.
### Academic & Research Value
*How this tool serves institutional and group needs*
- **Research Integrity**: Becomes a core tool for digital humanities and reproducibility studies by making provenance and process data easily accessible and verifiable.
- **Funder Confidence**: Demonstrates to funding bodies (like NEH, IMLS) that the institution has a robust system for verifying its preservation claims.
## Ecosystem Integration & Synergies
### EverArchive Tool Relationships
*How this tool works with other EverArchive tools to create compound value*
- **EverArchive Storage Manager**: EverScan is the primary monitoring interface for the `Storage Manager`, visualizing the health and distribution of the nodes and data it orchestrates.
- **EverArchive Blockchain Interface**: It reads and interprets the on-chain data (signatures, rights) managed by the `Blockchain Interface`, presenting it in a human-readable format.
- **EverArchive Web Portal**: The `Web Portal` will embed views and components from EverScan to show users the status of their individual files directly within their dashboard.
### Workflow Integration Points
*How this tool fits into broader user workflows*
- **Input Sources**: Reads data from the EverNode network, Chia Data Layer, Filecoin, and Arweave APIs; ingests logs and status reports from the `Storage Manager`.
- **Output Destinations**: Web-based dashboards, PDF audit reports, API endpoints for third-party monitoring tools, embedded widgets in the `Web Portal`.
## Foundation Technical Concept
### Core Functional Requirements
*What this tool must do to deliver the value proposition*
- **Essential Function 1**: A backend service that continuously queries and aggregates status data from all components of the storage trinity (EverNodes, Arweave, Filecoin).
- **Essential Function 2**: An interactive frontend application that can render complex lineage graphs, display geographic node maps, and provide searchable, filterable views of archived objects and network components.
- **Essential Function 3**: A robust reporting engine capable of generating scheduled or on-demand audit reports for institutional compliance and network health analysis.
### Integration Requirements
*How this tool must connect to deliver ecosystem value*
- **Data Source Integration**: Must have read-only API access to `EverNode` status endpoints, the Chia and Arweave blockchains, and the internal database of the `Storage Manager`.
- **UI Integration**: Must be designed to allow its key components (e.g., a "file status" widget) to be embedded as iframes or web components into the `Web Portal`.
### Success Metrics
*How to measure if this tool delivers its intended value*
- **User Success Indicator 1**: Time-to-verification: A user can confirm the full storage status and provenance of any given file in under 30 seconds.
- **User Success Indicator 2**: Reduction in manual audit time for institutional partners (target: 90% reduction in time spent gathering data for compliance reports).
- **System Health Metric**: The dashboard successfully identifies a failing node or a data-integrity issue before it impacts the network's overall SLA.
