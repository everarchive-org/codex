- **Primary Users**: Software developers, game developers, research programmers working on creative and technical projects
- **Secondary Users**: Development team leads, technical artists, academic researchers, open source maintainers
- **Use Contexts**: Software application development, game development, research programming, open source contribution, academic software projects

### Consolidated Capabilities
*The main things this tool enables users to accomplish*

1. **Multi-Platform Development Integration**: Comprehensive integration with Git version control, JIRA project management, and Unity game development environments for complete development workflow documentation
2. **Research-Aware Development Documentation**: Specialized capture of research paper references, whiteboard equation capture, and academic development workflows that bridge research and implementation
3. **Extended Development Lab Notebook**: Comprehensive documentation system with design wiki integration that treats software development as an experimental and creative process requiring systematic record-keeping

## User Journey Enablement

### Workflow Transformation
*How this tool changes what's possible for users*

**Before This Tool**:
- Developers lose context about why certain technical decisions were made and what research informed implementation choices
- Project management data exists in isolation from actual code development, making it difficult to understand project evolution
- Game development asset changes and build processes are poorly documented, leading to lost knowledge about creative technical decisions
- Research-oriented development lacks systematic integration between academic sources and implementation work

**With This Tool**:
- Comprehensive integration between research, planning, implementation, and delivery phases of development
- Automatic correlation between project management activities, code changes, and research references
- Complete game development workflow preservation including asset tracking and build history
- Seamless integration between academic research and software implementation for research-driven development

### Source Scenario Examples
