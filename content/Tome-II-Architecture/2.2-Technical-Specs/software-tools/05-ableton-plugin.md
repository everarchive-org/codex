- **Primary Users**: Musicians, producers, audio engineers using Ableton Live for music creation
- **Secondary Users**: Music educators, students, remix artists, audio researchers, music therapy practitioners
- **Use Contexts**: Original music composition, remix and mashup creation, live performance preparation, music education, audio post-production

### Consolidated Capabilities
*The main things this tool enables users to accomplish*

1. **Automatic Project Evolution Tracking**: Seamless monitoring of Ableton Live project folders with automatic version detection and sequential naming (Echo-v1.als, Echo-v2.als), preserving complete creative development timeline
2. **Comprehensive MIDI Preservation**: Complete capture and preservation of MIDI data, controller information, and musical composition elements with project evolution tracking for creative analysis
3. **Audio Processing Documentation**: Detailed capture of audio processing chains, effects configurations, mixing decisions, and production techniques for technique preservation and learning

## User Journey Enablement

### Workflow Transformation
*How this tool changes what's possible for users*

**Before This Tool**:
- Musicians lose track of creative iterations and can't easily compare different versions of their compositions
- MIDI data and production techniques are lost when projects are simplified or stems are bounced
