# Software Tool: EverScribe
**Tool ID**: 18  
**Category**: Institutional & Research  
**Development Status**: Specification Complete  
**Last Updated**: July 6, 2025
## Tool Overview
### Primary Purpose
*A complete, intelligent system for institutions that automates the analysis of large collections and provides a human-in-the-loop workbench for archivists to efficiently catalog, describe, and apply metadata.*
EverScribe is a unified solution designed to solve the problem of "born-digital" archival backlogs. It combines a powerful backend analysis engine with a specialized frontend interface, allowing institutions to process massive collections with machine speed while ensuring professional human oversight and accuracy.
### Target Users & Contexts
*Who uses this tool and in what scenarios*
- **Primary Users**: Professional archivists, academic librarians, museum curators, corporate records managers.
- **Secondary Users**: Research assistants processing large datasets, community historians organizing digital archives.
- **Use Contexts**: A university library ingesting a professor's 30-year digital correspondence, a museum cataloging a digitized photo collection, a research institute processing field data.
### Consolidated Capabilities
*The main things this tool enables users to accomplish*
1. **Comprehensive Content Intelligence**: A backend engine performs large-scale analysis on entire collections, using OCR, speech-to-text, and named entity recognition to understand the raw content.
2. **Automated Metadata Generation**: Based on its analysis, the system automatically suggests a complete set of metadata for each item, compliant with archival standards (e.g., Dublin Core, METS, MODS).
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Review Workbench**: Provides a streamlined interface for archivists to efficiently validate, edit, or reject system-generated suggestions in bulk, combining machine speed with professional judgment.
4. **Risk & Compliance Flagging**: Proactively identifies and flags potentially sensitive contentâ€”such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or complex rights issuesâ€”for mandatory manual review to ensure privacy and legal compliance.
## User Journey Enablement
### Workflow Transformation
*How this tool changes what's possible for users*
**Before This Tool**:
- Cataloging is a painstaking, manual, and time-consuming process, creating huge backlogs of uncatalogued material.
- Discovering relationships between items in a large collection is difficult and relies on memory and serendipity.
- Identifying sensitive PII is a major risk, with high potential for human error.
**With This Tool**:
- The "first pass" of cataloging is done in minutes or hours, not weeks or months. The archivist's role shifts from data entry to high-level review and curation.
- Deep, thematic connections across a collection are automatically revealed, leading to richer and more useful finding aids.
- PII and rights issues are proactively flagged, dramatically reducing institutional risk and ensuring compliance.
- The cataloging backlog is cleared, making new collections accessible to researchers much faster.
### Source Scenario Examples
*Concrete examples from source materials showing tool value*
#### **Scenario 1: The Professor's Digital Archive**
- **Source Context**: The concept of "AI-assisted cataloging" to support institutional workflows.
- **Challenge Addressed**: An academic library receives 2 terabytes of a retiring professor's files, including emails, drafts, and photos. Cataloging this manually would take over a year.
- **Value Delivered**: EverScribe ingests the entire collection, its backend engine OCRs the documents and identifies key topics, and its frontend workbench presents the archivist with pre-populated metadata for every item, with emails containing student info already flagged for review. The archivist can process the entire collection in weeks, not years.

## Institutional & Scale Benefits
### Organizational Value
*How this tool serves institutional and group needs*
- **Eliminates Backlogs**: Provides a scalable solution to the massive and growing problem of born-digital backlogs in cultural heritage institutions.
- **Reduces Risk**: Automated PII and rights flagging helps institutions meet their legal and ethical obligations regarding privacy and copyright.
- **Increases ROI on Collections**: Makes newly acquired collections searchable and accessible to researchers in a fraction of the time, maximizing the value of the acquisition.
## Ecosystem Integration & Synergies
### EverArchive Tool Relationships
*How this tool works with other EverArchive tools to create compound value*
- **EverPortal / EverCLI**: The workbench is a key step in the ingest workflow initiated by the `EverPortal` (for drag-and-drop) or the `EverCLI` (for large batch ingest).
- **EverArchive Academic Suite**: The high-quality, human-vetted metadata generated by EverScribe is consumed by the `Academic Suite` to ensure its compliance checks and submission wizards are accurate.
- **EverScan**: Once cataloging is complete, the rich metadata generated by EverScribe is searchable and viewable through `EverScan`.
### Workflow Integration Points
*How this tool fits into broader user workflows*
- **Input Sources**: A batch of newly ingested files (e.g., a zip file, a directory) from the `EverCLI` or `EverPortal`.
- **Output Destinations**: Clean, validated, standards-compliant metadata written to the EverArchive database, ready to be indexed for search and discovery.
## Foundation Technical Concept
### Core Functional Requirements
*What this tool must do to deliver the value proposition*
- **Essential Function 1**: A powerful backend analysis service that can manage large-scale, asynchronous jobs for OCR, NER, and topic modeling on ingested collections.
- **Essential Function 2**: A web-based user interface (the "Workbench") designed for bulk review, with features like batch-approve/reject, powerful search/filtering of suggestions, and a clear distinction between system-suggested and human-verified data.
- **Essential Function 3**: A rules engine for flagging content, allowing administrators to configure what constitutes PII or a rights concern that requires mandatory review.
### Success Metrics
*How to measure if this tool delivers its intended value*
- **User Success Indicator 1**: Reduction in time-per-item cataloged (target: reduce average cataloging time by 80% compared to a fully manual workflow).
- **User Success Indicator 2**: Suggestion approval rate (target: over 75% of system-generated metadata suggestions are approved by the archivist with minimal or no changes).
- **Workflow Improvement Metric**: A measurable reduction in the institution's born-digital cataloging backlog within 12 months of adoption.
