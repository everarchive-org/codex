## Purpose & Scope

This document identifies and documents the **foundational concepts** that underpin the entire EverArchive system. These are the core architectural primitives, philosophical principles, system invariants, and conceptual frameworks that everything else depends on. 

Rather than features or implementation details, these concepts represent the fundamental building blocks from which all other aspects of EverArchive are constructed. Understanding these concepts is essential for grasping how EverArchive works at the conceptual level.

## Architectural Primitives
*Core design patterns, data models, and structural elements that define EverArchive's technical approach*

### 1. Deep Authorship 3-Layer Model

**Definition**: The foundational architectural pattern that organizes creative memory into three distinct layers:
- **Core Layer**: Private, encrypted thoughts and raw creative process
- **Process Layer**: Semi-private evolution, iterations, and creative journey
- **Surface Layer**: Public, polished works intended for sharing

**Why Foundational**: This model is the cornerstone of the entire system. It drives:
- The technical structure of Deep Authorship Packages (DAP format)
- Access control and encryption strategies
- User interface design patterns
- Discovery and search architectures
- Rights management and sovereignty enforcement

**Canonical References**:
- Tome I, 1.2 - The Principles of Deep Authorship (Principle IV)
- Tome II, 2.2 - Deep Authorship Package Technical Specification (Section 2.2)
- Tome I, 1.0 - Essence and Vision (Lightning Moment #2)

**System Dependencies**: Without this model, EverArchive would be just another backup system. It's what transforms "storage" into "memory preservation."

### 2. Deep Authorship Package (DAP) Format

**Definition**: A sovereign, time-interpretable, and self-contained data container that implements the 3-Layer Model with mandatory encryption, cryptographic signatures, and metadata preservation.

**Why Foundational**: This is the atomic unit of the entire system. Everything else—storage, discovery, sharing, governance—operates on DAP objects. The format defines:
- How creative memory is technically preserved
- What constitutes a complete archival unit
- How sovereignty is technically enforced
- How future compatibility is maintained

**Canonical References**:
- Tome II, 2.2 - Deep Authorship Package Technical Specification (complete specification)
- Tome II, 2.1 - Canonical Architecture (Article II)

**System Dependencies**: All tools, APIs, storage systems, and user interfaces must understand DAP format. It's the universal currency of the EverArchive ecosystem.

### 3. Storage Trinity Architecture

**Definition**: A three-pillar storage approach combining:
- **Arweave**: Blockchain-guaranteed permanence with one-time payment
- **IPFS**: Distributed, content-addressed rapid access
- **Physical Vaults**: Air-gapped cold storage for catastrophic recovery

**Why Foundational**: This architecture solves the fundamental challenge of "forever" storage by eliminating single points of failure across technical, economic, and physical domains.

**Canonical References**:
- Tome II, 2.1 - Canonical Architecture (Article III)
- Tome I, 1.1 - The EverArchive Manifesto (Storage Trinity specifications)

**System Dependencies**: All preservation promises, economic models, and disaster recovery plans depend on this architecture. Without it, EverArchive cannot fulfill its "forever" mission.

### 4. Schema Projector Framework

**Definition**: A universal translation layer enabling bidirectional conversion between Deep Authorship Package format and established archival standards (METS, MODS, Dublin Core, PREMIS).

**Why Foundational**: This framework enables institutional adoption without forcing abandonment of existing systems. It bridges EverArchive's innovative features with the archival world's established practices.

**Canonical References**:
- Tome II, 2.3 - Discovery & Access Infrastructure (Chapter 11)
- Tome II, 2.2 - Deep Authorship Package Technical Specification (Section 8)

**System Dependencies**: Institutional partnerships, discovery systems, and format migration all rely on this framework. It's what makes EverArchive interoperable rather than isolated.

## Philosophical Principles
*Core values, ethics, and mission-critical beliefs that guide all decisions*

### 5. Creator Sovereignty

**Definition**: The absolute, technically-enforced principle that creators hold ultimate and inalienable control over access, use, and legacy of their own creative memory, especially the private Core Layer.

**Why Foundational**: This principle drives every technical and governance decision. It determines:
- Encryption strategies (zero-knowledge required)
- Governance models (non-extractive by design)
- Economic frameworks (infrastructure, not platform)
- User experience design (creator-controlled sharing)

**Canonical References**:
- Tome III, 3.1 - Governance Constitution (Article I, Principle #1)
- Tome I, 1.2 - The Principles of Deep Authorship (Principle II)
- Tome I, 1.0 - Essence and Vision (North Star Principle #1)

**System Dependencies**: Without this principle, EverArchive would become another surveillance platform. It's what makes creators trust the system with their most vulnerable thoughts.

### 6. Infrastructure not Platform

**Definition**: EverArchive builds foundational infrastructure that enables value creation by others, rather than capturing value for itself. Like the internet or roads, it provides the foundation layer.

**Why Foundational**: This principle shapes:
- Economic models (no revenue extraction)
- Governance structures (public good orientation)
- Technical architecture (open protocols, not proprietary platforms)
- Partnership strategies (enabling, not competing)

**Canonical References**:
- Tome I, 1.1 - The EverArchive Manifesto (Infrastructure vision)
- Tome III, 3.2 - Economic Framework (Article I, Principle #1)

**System Dependencies**: This principle prevents mission drift toward platform capitalism and ensures long-term sustainability through infrastructure support rather than user exploitation.

### 7. Process over Product

**Definition**: The creative journey—including doubts, failures, and breakthroughs—is as valuable as (or more valuable than) the final polished output.

**Why Foundational**: This principle justifies the entire Deep Authorship approach. It drives:
- The 3-Layer Model architecture
- Capture tool design (preserving process, not just results)
- Discovery systems (finding by emotional journey, not just keywords)
- Educational applications (learning from failure, not just success)

**Canonical References**:
- Tome I, 1.2 - The Principles of Deep Authorship (Principle I)
- Tome I, 1.0 - Essence and Vision (Core Belief #1)

**System Dependencies**: Without this principle, EverArchive would be redundant with existing backup systems. It's what makes preservation meaningful rather than mechanical.

## System Invariants
*Technical and operational requirements that must always hold for the system to work*

### 8. Zero-Knowledge Encryption for Core Layer

**Definition**: The Core Layer must always be encrypted with keys held only by the creator. The system cannot decrypt this data by design, ensuring mathematical privacy guarantees.

**Why Foundational**: This is the technical enforcement of Creator Sovereignty. Without it:
- Creators cannot trust the system with vulnerable thoughts
- Governments or corporations could compel access
- The Core Layer would become a surveillance database
- The entire Deep Authorship model would fail

**Canonical References**:
- Tome II, 2.2 - Deep Authorship Package Technical Specification (Section 6.2)
- Tome I, 1.0 - Essence and Vision (North Star Principle #1)

**System Dependencies**: All Core Layer functionality, creator trust, and legal protection strategies depend on this invariant. It cannot be compromised for convenience or features.

### 9. Permanent Preservation Guarantee

**Definition**: Once stored in EverArchive, content must be preserved permanently with >95% probability for 200+ years, backed by mathematical guarantees and economic models.

**Why Foundational**: This invariant is the core promise of EverArchive. It drives:
- Storage Trinity architecture requirements
- Economic sustainability models (endowment approach)
- Technical evolution frameworks (format migration)
- Legal governance structures (permanence-focused)

**Canonical References**:
- Tome II, 2.1 - Canonical Architecture (Storage Trinity)
- Tome III, 3.2 - Economic Framework (Endowment Model)

**System Dependencies**: All user trust, institutional partnerships, and civilizational mission depend on this guarantee. Without it, EverArchive becomes just expensive backup.

### 10. Open Source and Non-Proprietary

**Definition**: All core protocols, formats, and reference implementations must remain open source to prevent capture and ensure interoperability.

**Why Foundational**: This invariant ensures:
- No single entity can control the ecosystem
- The system can survive corporate or organizational failure
- Innovation happens through collaboration, not competition
- Long-term format viability through transparency

**Canonical References**:
- Tome III, 3.1 - Governance Constitution (Article I, Principle #6)
- Tome I, 1.1 - The EverArchive Manifesto (Open Infrastructure)

**System Dependencies**: All technical specifications, governance models, and sustainability strategies depend on this invariant to prevent capture and ensure permanence.

## Conceptual Frameworks
*Mental models that organize understanding and guide system design*

### 11. Memory vs. Backup Paradigm

**Definition**: EverArchive preserves "memory" (meaning, context, relationships, emotion) rather than just "backup" (mechanical file preservation). Memory is organic and relational; backup is mechanical and isolated.

**Why Foundational**: This framework shapes:
- What gets preserved (not just files, but context and meaning)
- How discovery works (by relationship and emotion, not just keywords)
- Why the process matters (memory includes the journey, not just destination)
- How value is created (through understanding, not just access)

**Canonical References**:
- Tome I, 1.1 - The EverArchive Manifesto ("We are not building a better backup")
- Tome I, 1.0 - Essence and Vision ("The One Thing to Remember")

**System Dependencies**: This paradigm distinguishes EverArchive from all existing solutions and justifies its unique approach to preservation, discovery, and user experience.

### 12. Civilizational Memory Infrastructure

**Definition**: EverArchive is infrastructure for humanity's collective creative memory, operating at civilizational scale across centuries and cultures, not just individual or institutional needs.

**Why Foundational**: This framework drives:
- Sustainability models (century-scale thinking)
- Governance structures (global, multi-generational)
- Technical architecture (post-quantum, format-agnostic)
- Cultural sensitivity (universal access, anti-colonial)

**Canonical References**:
- Tome I, 1.1 - The EverArchive Manifesto (Civilizational threat analysis)
- Tome II, 2.1 - Canonical Architecture (Deep-time design)

**System Dependencies**: All long-term planning, governance decisions, and technical choices must consider civilizational impact, not just immediate utility.

### 13. Antifragility Design Philosophy

**Definition**: The system is designed not merely to resist shocks, but to become stronger from them. Failures in one area prompt diversification and strengthening of the whole.

**Why Foundational**: This philosophy shapes:
- Storage architecture (redundancy across multiple failure domains)
- Governance structures (learning from disputes)
- Economic models (antifragile through diversification)
- Technical evolution (improvement through use)

**Canonical References**:
- Tome II, 2.1 - Canonical Architecture (Article VII, Meta-Architecture)
- Tome III, 3.5 - Resilience & Recovery Plan

**System Dependencies**: All resilience planning, crisis response, and long-term viability depend on this design philosophy to ensure the system improves through challenges.

### 14. Progressive Trust and Sovereignty

**Definition**: A framework that allows creators to begin anonymously and progressively build verified identity while maintaining full control over their sovereignty level and data sharing.

**Why Foundational**: This framework enables:
- Universal access (no barriers to entry)
- Vulnerable creator protection (anonymous creation)
- Institutional partnership (verified identity options)
- Anti-colonial design (no forced Western identity systems)

**Canonical References**:
- Tome II, 2.2 - Deep Authorship Package Technical Specification (Section 5.1)
- Tome II, 2.4 - Creator Tools Framework (Progressive sovereignty)

**System Dependencies**: All identity systems, access controls, and institutional partnerships depend on this framework to balance openness with trust requirements.

## Usage Guidelines

**For Website Development**: Present these foundational concepts BEFORE features to help visitors understand the underlying principles that make EverArchive unique.

**For Technical Implementation**: All new features and tools must align with and build upon these foundational concepts. Any conflict indicates either a design error or the need to revisit foundational assumptions.

**For Governance Decisions**: These concepts serve as the "constitutional" principles that guide all policy and strategic decisions. They cannot be changed without fundamental reconsideration of EverArchive's mission.

**For Partner Communication**: Use these concepts to explain WHY EverArchive works differently from other solutions, not just WHAT it does differently.

## Conclusion

These 14 foundational concepts represent the essential building blocks from which all of EverArchive is constructed. They are:

- **Irreducible**: Each concept is fundamental and cannot be derived from the others
- **Universal**: Every aspect of EverArchive depends on these concepts
- **Immutable**: Changes to these concepts would fundamentally alter what EverArchive is
- **Generative**: All features, policies, and innovations must flow from these foundations

Understanding these concepts is essential for understanding EverArchive itself. They are the DNA from which the entire organism grows.
